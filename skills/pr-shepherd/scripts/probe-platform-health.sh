# probe-platform-health.sh — "is the platform degraded right now, or is this a
# real defect?", answered as a structured verdict a caller REPORTS.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A hard `gh` error is already handled everywhere — an
# API-failure tick proves nothing and the callers know it. What was not handled
# is a `gh` call that SUCCEEDS and returns incomplete data, which the caller
# then reads as live state. Measured 2026-08-26 on this repo's PR #283 during a
# platform outage: `gh pr view 283 --json statusCheckRollup` exited 0 with two
# entries and no `ci`; `gh run list` for that head returned no `CI` run at all
# across ~40 minutes while the two PRIOR heads on the same branch had one within
# minutes; `mergeStateStatus` read `BLOCKED`; later `ci` appeared in the rollup
# with an EMPTY state and still no run behind it. Nothing errored. The
# coordinator produced three hypotheses — Actions queueing, a path filter, a
# transient miss — all three wrong, and proposed closing and reopening the PR,
# which during an outage could have made it worse. The real cause was known only
# because the operator said so.
#
# THE ASYMMETRY IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, and it is the part a later "simplify the
# verdicts" sweep will flatten:
#
#     red explains a stall. GREEN EXPLAINS NOTHING, and says so in those words.
#
# A green status page is NOT evidence of health. githubstatus.com lags real
# degradation by minutes to tens of minutes and routinely under-reports partial
# Actions failures. So the probe may only ever ADD an explanation. If a caller
# reads green and concludes "so this is a real defect — escalate", the probe is
# WORSE than not having one: it converts an unknown into a confident wrong
# answer. The self-measured signal is what is load-bearing; the status page
# answers a different question — is it them or us — and answers it late.
#
# NEVER A GATE. This changes what a tick SAYS, not what it DOES. The verdict
# must appear in no merge, hold, block or redispatch decision. A PR missing a
# required check is held either way — the hold was already correct, the
# ATTRIBUTION was what was missing. Worth recording why the merge path is the
# least exposed surface: branch protection is enforced SERVER-SIDE, so a PR
# missing a required check is refused by GitHub itself and not by this loop's
# reading of it. The cost of degradation here is wasted work and wrong
# escalations, not bad merges.
#
# THE EXIT CODE CARRIES NO VERDICT, DELIBERATELY. Every one of the four verdicts
# exits 0; only a usage error exits non-zero. This is a deliberate ASYMMETRY
# with stack-probe.sh, whose exit codes ARE a gate (23/24 in merge-shepherd.sh)
# because that is its job — and aligning the two is exactly the tidy to refuse.
# A verdict in an exit code is one `set -e`, one `&&`, or one `if` away from
# being the gate this must never be, and that wiring would be invisible in
# review. Structure it out instead of forbidding it in prose.
#
# Usage:
#   probe-platform-health.sh [--pr <n>] [--repo owner/name]
#                            [--status-url <url>] [--min-age <secs>]
#   Repo defaults to the cwd checkout's `origin` remote, read LOCALLY with git
#   and never through `gh` — see the derivation's own paragraph; --repo overrides.
#   With no --pr there is NO first-party measurement, so a green page yields
#   `unknown` rather than `healthy` — see the table below.
#
# Env:
#   PLATFORM_STATUS_URL        attribution endpoint
#                              (default https://www.githubstatus.com/api/v2/summary.json)
#   PLATFORM_STATUS_TIMEOUT    seconds for that fetch (default 5)
#   PLATFORM_GH_TIMEOUT        seconds before any ONE `gh` call is sent TERM
#                              (default 20), applied with `timeout`/`gtimeout`
#                              when either is on PATH. The true per-call ceiling
#                              is this PLUS a fixed 5s kill grace — 25s at the
#                              default, and 80s worst case for the whole run;
#                              see THE WORST CASE below the env list.
#   PLATFORM_PROBE_MIN_AGE     head-age floor in seconds (default 300) — below it
#                              the run-COMPARISON signals are SUPPRESSED, because
#                              a workflow that has not started yet is not
#                              missing, and firing on a fresh push manufactures
#                              exactly the confident wrong answer this exists to
#                              prevent.
#   PLATFORM_STATUS_COMPONENTS comma-separated, lower-cased substrings of the
#                              status-page components that can plausibly explain
#                              missing CHECK data (default below). Scoping is not
#                              optional: githubstatus.com carries a dozen
#                              components, and treating a Copilot or Codespaces
#                              blip as an explanation for a red `ci` invents an
#                              excuse for a genuine failure — the same
#                              confident-wrong-answer this file exists to refuse,
#                              pointed the other way.
#
# THE WORST CASE IS 80 SECONDS, AND THAT NUMBER IS A CONSTRAINT RATHER THAN A
# STATISTIC (issue #314). Three bounded `gh` sites at 25s each plus the 5s
# `curl` is 3 x (20 + 5) + 5 = 80s, against the 120s default tool timeout of the
# harness the shipped callers run under. That harness kills a run past its
# timeout, and a killed run yields NO JSON AND NO STDERR — #303's shape one
# layer up, which the emitter fallback cannot answer because the script never
# reaches it. So the arithmetic has to fit with room, and the gate re-derives it
# from these defaults rather than trusting this sentence. Raising
# PLATFORM_GH_TIMEOUT past ~33 spends that room: the caller raising it owns the
# tool timeout too. The earlier default was 30, which put the no-`--repo` path at
# 145s — over the limit, in the header's own documented invocation.
#
# THE FOUR VERDICTS. They are four distinct answers and collapsing any pair
# re-creates the bug:
#
#   first-party      status page     verdict
#   -----------      -----------     -------
#   anomaly          incident        degraded (attributed)
#   anomaly          operational     degraded (unattributed)   <- never healthy
#   anomaly          unknown         degraded (unattributed)   <- never healthy
#   clean            incident        degraded (attributed)
#   clean            operational     healthy
#   clean            unknown         unknown                   <- never healthy
#   not measured     incident        degraded (attributed)
#   not measured     operational     unknown                   <- never healthy
#   not measured     unknown         unknown
#
# AN UNREACHABLE STATUS ENDPOINT NEVER MANUFACTURES A VERDICT OF ITS OWN. It
# contributes `unknown` and nothing else: it can never produce `healthy` (a
# verifier that degrades to "assume fine" is worth nothing on the day it
# matters — the verify-gotcha-claims.sh rule) and it can never on its own
# produce `degraded` (rows 6, 8 and 9 above). Where it appears beside a
# first-party anomaly (row 3) the DEGRADATION was measured first-party and only
# the attribution is missing, which is what the word "unattributed" means — the
# vocabulary has no fifth value for it, and a page you could not read adds
# exactly as much as a page that is green, which is nothing. Read row 3 and row
# 6 together before "aligning" either one.
#
# `clean` MEANS SOMETHING WAS MEASURED AND CAME BACK CLEAN — NEVER "NOTHING WAS
# LOOKED AT". This is the FIRST-PARTY door into `healthy`, and it is the one an
# earlier edition of this script left open: a single-commit PR branch has no
# prior head to compare against, so the run comparison had no baseline, found
# nothing, and reported `clean` -> `healthy` on a branch whose CI had never
# started. That is #285 one step EARLIER than the incident it was written for,
# and the dominant branch shape in this org. So each first-party check reports
# whether it could RUN. ONLY THE RUN COMPARISON EARNS `clean` -- the sentence
# that used to stand here said `clean` requires that "at least one of them did"
# and then listed BOTH checks, which is the exact inverse of the rule four lines
# below it, in the same paragraph. A reader who stopped at the list concluded
# the empty-state check could earn `clean`, which is the door the rule exists to
# nail shut. `ROLLUP_CHECK` is REPORTED in `checks_run` and contributes
# anomalies; it is consulted by no verdict path at all.
# The run comparison earns `clean` only with at least one prior head on the
# branch, a non-empty intersection across them (an empty one compared nothing),
# a head past the age floor, an untruncated runs page, and a rollup that is not
# empty while runs exist on this head. The empty-state check is a real signal
# but it detects a MALFORMED rollup entry and can never detect an ABSENT one —
# which is #285's headline signal — so a rollup that simply lacks `ci` looks
# identical to a healthy one through it. Accepting it as sufficient left this
# door open on the exact shape the probe was written for: measured, #285's own
# rollup on a single-commit branch reported `healthy`.
# Not earned -> `not_measured`, whose green-page row is `unknown`, and the
# REASON is preserved rather than blanked — `no_prior_heads`,
# `no_required_baseline`, `head_too_fresh`, `runs_page_truncated`,
# `rollup_empty_with_runs`, `head_age_unknown`, `run_comparison_failed`,
# `pr_read_failed`, `probe_errors_present`, `verdict_emitter_failed`,
# `repo_lookup_failed`, `no_pr_given` and `nothing_measurable` are precisely
# why the verdict is not a measurement. That list is the full set the code
# emits; if you add a reason, add it here.
#
# A gh TRANSPORT FAILURE IS `not_measured`, NOT AN ANOMALY, and this is a
# deliberate reading of #285 rather than a slip. #285 lists "gh calls erroring
# or returning structurally incomplete payloads" among the first-party signals,
# and a *semantically* incomplete payload — a rollup missing a check, an entry
# with no state — is exactly that and is treated as an anomaly below. But a call
# that FAILS, or comes back unparsable, or omits the key it was asked for,
# cannot distinguish a platform fault from an expired token, a rate limit or a
# closed laptop. Reporting a local auth failure as "the platform is degraded" is
# the confident wrong answer this file exists to refuse, so a transport failure
# records itself in `probe_errors`, makes the run `not_measured`, and lets the
# status page decide the row. The cost is stated: during a real outage that also
# breaks gh, a green page yields `unknown` rather than `degraded`. `unknown`
# explains nothing, which is the truth — we do not know.
#
# EVERY `gh` CALL IS BOUNDED, AND A TIMED-OUT CALL IS A TRANSPORT FAILURE. The
# probe's entire trigger condition is "GitHub may be degraded right now", and
# an edition of this file left the three LOAD-BEARING calls (`gh pr view`, the
# commit read, the `actions/runs` read) unbounded while bounding the OPTIONAL
# attribution fetch — the one its own header calls never load-bearing. A hang
# there costs the caller its whole tick, and the caller is a loop. So the NAME
# `gh` is the bound: a shell function shadows the binary and prefixes
# `timeout`/`gtimeout` when either is on PATH, and the only reach to the binary
# is one `command gh`, inside that function. A wrapper under its own name
# (`gh_bounded`) came first and is exactly the shape to refuse — a chokepoint
# by CONVENTION, where the next reader written as `gh api … | jq` is unbounded
# and looks entirely normal, and the gate's grep for it refused one spelling
# out of ten. Shadowing the name makes it structural: a call written by an
# author who never heard of a wrapper runs under the bound all the same. In the
# bounded branch `timeout` resolves `gh` through execvp, which sees no shell
# function, so the real binary and the gate's mock are reached the same way.
# `timeout` reports a fired bound as exit 124 — or as 137
# when the child ignored TERM and the 5s kill grace had to fire (128 + KILL,
# preserved after escalation; measured on coreutils 9.11). BOTH are the bound
# firing, and `bound_fired` is the ONE predicate that says so: an edition of
# this file recognised 124 alone, which meant the exact path `-k 5` exists for
# was the one path it could not name. Either code lands
# in the SAME `gh_call_failed` path as any other non-zero exit: `not_measured`,
# NEVER an anomaly. That is not a shortcut — it is the transport-failure rule
# above applied unchanged, and it is the reading to keep: a call we cut off
# ourselves tells us even less about the platform than one that errored.
# Where NEITHER binary is on PATH the calls run exactly as they did before and
# the probe records `timeout_unavailable` in `probe_errors`, because a bound
# that silently did not apply is the same "silence read as an answer" this file
# exists to refuse. That entry is scoped `probe`, not `first_party`: the calls
# still ran and their results are as trustworthy as they ever were, so folding
# it in would turn every run on a host without coreutils into `not_measured`.
#
# THE EMITTER CANNOT EXIT 0 WITH EMPTY STDOUT. The final `jq -n` used to run
# with no handler under a script with no `set -e` and an unconditional
# `exit 0`, so a dead emitter handed the caller exit 0 and NO output —
# `jq -r .verdict` then yields the empty string, which is not one of the four
# verdicts and is not `unknown` either, while the stderr summary line still
# printed and looked normal. Measured: `jq -n --argjson a "" '$a'` exits 2 and
# prints nothing, and `$ANOMALIES`/`$PROBE_ERRORS` are the only two emitter
# inputs nothing validates before use (the counts derived from them ARE
# defended, so the file already treats them as possibly unusable). The status
# is now captured and the output re-parsed before it is printed; on any failure
# a minimal HAND-BUILT `unknown` object is emitted instead.
# THAT OBJECT IS FOUR KEYS — `verdict`, `self_measured_reason`
# (`verdict_emitter_failed`), `explains` and `pr` — and deliberately NOT the
# emitter's shape. The first edition was a 16-key literal mirroring the
# emitter: a second copy of the output schema, held in step by nothing.
# Measured, renaming a key in it left the gate green, and the next key added
# to the emitter would have drifted out of it silently — #167's rule (never
# transcribe the table), inside this file. The rule that replaced it is not
# "carry nothing" but "carry nothing that could be what broke it", and exactly
# one measured value clears that bar: `pr` is validated at parse time as digits
# with no leading zero, so it is a bare JSON number BY CONSTRUCTION and cannot
# malform the literal, and it is the one fact a coordinator holding several PRs
# needs to attribute a dead run to any of them (#314). An edition of this
# paragraph refused it on the general principle and was right about every
# OTHER field: `repo` is shape-checked and never sanitised, a wider grammar
# than this literal can safely take, and the rest are precisely what could not
# be serialised — re-interpolating one re-runs the failure inside its own
# handler, since whatever killed the emitter (a ledger builder dying on the
# argv cap, or jq itself) is what a richer object would have to re-run.
# THE TWO LEDGERS STAY `--argjson`, ON PURPOSE. `--arg` plus `try fromjson
# catch []` would make the emitter unable to fail on inputs at all — and
# measured, an empty `$ANOMALIES` already reads as ZERO anomalies at the
# verdict (`length` over empty input is empty, and the guard turns that into
# 0), so that edition emits `healthy` beside an empty anomalies list after a
# jq failure inside `add_anomaly`. A ledger that cannot be parsed is a run
# whose verdict cannot be trusted; the emitter dying is the fail-closed door
# that lands it in `unknown`, and the gate mutation-proves the door by
# corrupting the ledger.
# It still exits 0: the no-verdict case is what a non-zero exit is reserved for,
# and this path HAS a verdict. Turning it into a non-zero exit would put a
# verdict in an exit code, which the paragraph above forbids.
#
# FIRST-PARTY SIGNALS (the load-bearing half; all are read-only):
#   missing_workflow_run  a (workflow, event) pair that ran on EVERY prior head
#                         of this branch has no run on the current head
#   no_run_for_head       prior heads carried runs; this head carries none
#   empty_state_check     a rollup entry with no status, no conclusion and no
#                         state — a CheckRun always has a status and a
#                         StatusContext always has a state, so all-three-empty
#                         is a placeholder, not a check that is running. It is
#                         a DIRECT read of the rollup, so it is neither
#                         age-suppressed nor conditional on the runs call —
#                         during an outage those are exactly what fail together.
#
# THE RUN COMPARISON IS RUN-TO-RUN, NOT ROLLUP-TO-RUN, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
# `statusCheckRollup` names CHECKS (for Actions, JOB names — "Analyze
# (actions)"), while `actions/runs` names WORKFLOWS ("CI"). They are different
# namespaces, so differencing one against the other reports a missing check for
# every workflow whose job names differ from its own name, on a perfectly
# healthy repo. Both sides of the difference therefore come from the SAME
# `actions/runs` payload, which is also exactly the comparison that was measured
# during the outage. The rollup is used only for the empty-state signal, which
# needs no cross-namespace comparison at all.
#
# THE BASELINE IS AN INTERSECTION, NOT A UNION, and the whitelist beside it is
# the other half of the same guard. A workflow legitimately absent from one head
# is ordinary: `paths:`/`paths-ignore:` filters (the norm in the monorepos this
# ships to), an `if:` condition. So
# a workflow counts as missing only if it ran on EVERY prior head examined and
# on none of the current one. And only head-triggered events are compared at
# all — a `workflow_dispatch` or `schedule` run on a prior head can never recur
# on this one, so a union-and-blacklist reading reports it missing forever.
# KNOWN LIMIT, stated rather than patched, and it has TWO shapes rather than
# one. (a) A path filter that matched every prior head and not this one still
# reports a missing run. (b) A workflow THIS VERY PR renames or deletes does
# too, and that shape was wrongly listed above as covered — the intersection
# guard makes a workflow ordinary when it is absent from SOME PRIOR head, and a
# deletion is absent from the CURRENT one, which is the opposite arrangement.
# Measured: prior heads running CI+Docs and a current head running CI only
# returns `degraded (unattributed)` naming `Docs`, i.e. the probe attributes the
# PR-s own change to the platform. Listing it as handled was worse than not
# mentioning it, because the next maintainer would not add it here. That is why this
# verdict is `unattributed` and why the probe gates nothing — a false positive
# costs an explanation, never a decision.
#
# PAGINATION IS A KNOWN LIMIT AND IT CUTS BOTH WAYS. One page of 100 runs,
# newest first, and BOTH directions are measured — an edition of this comment
# claimed each of them was the only one, so neither half may be deleted.
#   OVER-detect: dropping a whole prior head takes `required` from ["CI"] to
#     ["CI","Docs"] on a branch where a path filter had skipped that head, and
#     fabricates a missing-run anomaly.
#   UNDER-detect, and this WAS the direction that reached `healthy`: the page
#     boundary lands INSIDE the oldest included head's run set, so that head
#     contributes a TRUNCATED set, the intersection shrinks, and a genuinely
#     missing workflow drops out of `required`. Measured on two fixtures
#     differing ONLY in truncation, same underlying reality: the full page gave
#     `degraded (unattributed)` and the 100-run page gave `healthy`.
# That is now CLOSED. `truncated` was computed, reported, and then ignored by
# the one decision that consumes it, which is why recording it as a known limit
# was not enough. A truncated page no longer earns `clean`: it yields
# `not_measured` with reason `runs_page_truncated`. The test is `!= "no"` and
# not `= "yes"`, because `unknown` means the flag itself could not be read and
# certifies nothing either.
# `truncated` is still emitted, since suppressing the claim to completeness is
# not the same as hiding why. The ACCEPTED COST is real and is not a defect:
# on a branch with >= 100 head-triggered runs the probe can no longer emit
# `healthy` at all, only `unknown`. Over-detection is unchanged and still
# possible. Note also that `>= 100` against `per_page=100` cannot distinguish a
# complete 100-run page from a truncated one, so a branch sitting at exactly
# 100 is treated as truncated -- fail-closed, and deliberate.
#
# Read-only. Never merges, enqueues, re-runs, closes, reopens or comments.
#
# Emits one JSON object on stdout and a one-line human summary on stderr.

  # never feeds the first-party count below — that is the whole definition.
  # Its one kind today is `timeout_unavailable`: the measurement is intact and
  # the verdict is whatever it would have been; the entry only records that
  # the bound never applied. An earlier edition defined the scope as "where
  # the measurement itself is unaffected" and then listed the emitter fallback

# THE REPO IS DERIVED LOCALLY, AND THIS IS THE ONE PLACE THIS PROBE DEPARTS FROM
# ITS SIBLINGS (issue #314). `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` answers a LOCAL
# question — which repo is this checkout — through a REMOTE call, and on a
# network failure, an expired token or a 5xx it exits 1 with empty stdout,
# INDISTINGUISHABLE from "not in a repo at all". That is this file's dominant bug
# class again: an unknown converted into a confident wrong answer, at the one
# site whose trigger condition is "GitHub may be failing right now". Bounding the
# call (#312) taught it 124 and 137 and nothing else, so every OTHER non-zero
# exit inside a valid checkout still printed `not in a GitHub repo and --repo not
# given` and exited 1 with no verdict. A probe that exists to run during an
# outage must not need GitHub to work out where it is standing.
#
# So the slug comes from the `origin` remote. `git rev-parse` and
# `git remote get-url` read the local checkout and touch no network, which is why
# neither needs the bound the `gh` sites carry — the bounded sites drop from four
# to three, the worst-case runtime with them, and the exit-code special case
# disappears entirely. The OTHER plugin scripts keep `gh repo view`: this one is
# the deliberate exception, not a new convention, and the exception is earned by
# what the probe is for rather than by tidiness.
#
# THE REMOTE URL IS NEVER REPORTED, and that is a security decision rather than
# terseness. An https remote can carry credentials in its userinfo
# (`https://x-access-token:ghs_...@github.com/o/n`), `probe_errors[].detail` is a
# field SKILL.md orders the coordinator to REPORT, and this repo is PUBLIC by
# exception. So a detail names WHICH input broke and never its value — the same
# shape the emitter fallback's stderr line uses, and the reason no sanitiser is
# needed at this site at all.
#
# THE FAILURE SHAPES ARE ENUMERATED RATHER THAN COUNTED, which is CLAUDE.md's
# own rule about a number in prose: (a) no `git` on PATH, (b) `git rev-parse`
# exiting non-zero — no repository here, OR one git refused to read, which that
# command does not separate except in locale-dependent stderr — (c) a bare
# repository, which has no work tree, (d) no `origin` remote, and (e) an
# `origin` URL this parser does not accept. Each records its OWN detail
# under one `first_party repo_lookup_failed`, sets REPO_OK=0, and the run CARRIES
# ON to a real verdict — `not_measured`, which the status page can still
# attribute. NO USAGE ERROR AMONG THEM: a caller standing outside a checkout now
# gets `unknown` with a reason instead of exit 1 and no verdict at all, and exit
# 1 stays what it always was, a malformed argument, where no verdict exists.

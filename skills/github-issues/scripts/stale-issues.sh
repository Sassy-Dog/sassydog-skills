# Detect issues whose state is stale relative to recent ship history.
#
# Three detectors:
#   1. shipped-but-still-open — an open issue named by a merged PR that never
#      closed it. TWO arms, and every finding records which one fired
#      (`matched_via`: "title", "body", or "title+body"):
#        - title — a "(#N)" parenthetical in the PR title. A conventional-commit
#          title parenthetical is a hyperlink, NOT a Closes-keyword.
#        - body  — an "#N" in the PR body carrying NO closing keyword. This is
#          where the reference nearly always lives: GitHub appends "(#N)" to the
#          SQUASH-MERGE COMMIT title, not to the PR title, and the number it
#          appends is the PR's OWN (issue #337).
#      Either way the issue never auto-closed — needs manual review-and-close,
#      or a status comment if only half-shipped.
#   2. stub-body — open issue with a body shorter than 80 chars or that's just
#      a one-line placeholder. Almost certainly needs scoping before tackle.
#      IMPORTANT for consumers: before declaring a stub, check the issue's
#      COMMENTS (gh issue view N --comments) — some repos put scope in a
#      follow-up comment, not the OP body. This script only sees the body.
#   3. tracking-parent-complete — an OPEN issue with >= 1 child (any issue whose
#      body carries the literal `Part of #<N>` line groom-backlog's epic split
#      writes) where EVERY child is CLOSED. Nothing upstream can catch this:
#      GitHub moves a card only when a merged PR closes the issue via a
#      keyword, and a tracking parent is definitionally the issue no PR ever
#      names, so it can never self-close. Its children close one by one under
#      their own PRs and the parent sits open forever, counted as pending work
#      by every read of the backlog (issue #198 — three of eight open issues in
#      one repo were finished work). REPORT ONLY: a human closes, never this.
#
# Env: REPO=owner/name (default: inferred from cwd via gh)
#      ALL_LIMIT=<n> (default 500) — ceiling on detector 3's all-state pull. A
#        pull that comes back AT the ceiling is reported `truncated: true`;
#        that result is UNKNOWN, not clean. Re-run with a higher ALL_LIMIT.
#
# Exit: 0 the three sections were computed over complete pulls
#       10 SKIPPED or UNKNOWN — gh missing, no repo, or a pull that failed.
#          Never confuse it with 0: every detector here answers a healthy repo
#          with an empty list, so a degraded run that exits 0 is indistinguishable
#          from a clean one. That is the whole failure class this script exists
#          to close, so it must not reproduce it on its own inputs.
#
# Read-only with respect to the repo, GitHub and the network; it stages its
# three pulls in a temp dir it removes on exit.

# --- detector 1: shipped-but-still-open --------------------------------------
# Build map: issue_number -> [matching merged PRs]. TWO arms, and each finding
# records which one fired, because the arms carry very different weight and a
# reader has to be able to tell a title hit from a body hit.
#
# ARM 1 — the TITLE parenthetical. Scan EVERY parenthetical group in each title
# and pull all `#N` refs from inside. This catches:
#   - simple   "(#419)"           -> 419
#   - compound "(#419 + #421)"    -> 419, 421         (missed by the naive regex)
#   - csv      "(#419, #421)"     -> 419, 421
#   - trailing "(#458)" PR self-ref -> 458 (harmless: GitHub numbers issues and
#                                     PRs from ONE sequence, so a PR's own
#                                     number can never also be an open issue)
# The naive `\(#(\d+)\)` regex only matches the simple form — compound refs
# slipped through it in production and left shipped issues flagged-but-open.
#
# ARM 2 — the PR BODY. The title arm ALONE is near-vacuous wherever GitHub's
# squash-merge autotitle is the convention, because GitHub appends "(#N)" to the
# MERGE COMMIT title rather than the PR title, and the number it appends is the
# PR's OWN. Measured for issue #337: of the last 100 merged PRs in this repo
# only 3 titles carried any parenthetical, while 35 of the last 40 PR BODIES
# named an issue — the detector's sole input was present in 3% of PRs. A live
# miss followed: #316 was fixed by #328, which named it in the body with no
# closing keyword; #316 stayed open AND labelled `ready`, and this detector
# reported `[]`, which reads as a verified answer rather than as a blind spot.
#
# Arm 2 is deliberately BROAD — any `#N` in the body counts, not only refs under
# a fix-shaped phrase — because the miss it exists to catch is exactly the author
# who described the work without wording it as a close. That makes a body hit a
# REVIEW PROMPT rather than a verdict: a PR citing an issue for background is
# reported too, and `matched_via` is what lets the reader weigh it. Two
# exclusions keep that breadth from collapsing into "fires on everything":
#
#   - A ref governed by a CLOSING KEYWORD is not a finding. GitHub auto-closes
#     on those, so an open issue named that way is a cross-repo ref or a genuine
#     anomaly, not the omission this detector reports.
#   - HTML COMMENTS are stripped first. PR templates carry example refs inside
#     `<!-- -->` (this repo's own template carries `Closes #123`), authors leave
#     the comment in the body, and it is boilerplate rather than anyone's
#     reference — unstripped, the same template numbers would flag on EVERY PR.
#
# THOSE TWO EXCLUSIONS ARE THE ONLY THING BETWEEN UNTRUSTED PR TEXT AND A
# DETECTOR WHOSE ENTIRE PURPOSE IS TO STOP REPORTING A FALSE CLEAN, and each is
# a way to make it print `[]` again. Both are therefore built to fail toward
# REPORTING, never toward silence:
#
#   1. Suppression is POSITIONAL, never a body-global number set. The keyword
#      suppresses the one ref it governs, at that offset — not every later
#      mention of the same number. A set let one `Closes #316` anywhere in the
#      body silence every occurrence of 316 in it.
#   2. A keyword is read only from PROSE. Code fences, code spans and
#      quotations are blanked first, because none of them is GitHub asking to
#      close anything — and the backticked `Closes #N` is the form this repo's
#      own docs and PR template model, so without this a PR that merely
#      DOCUMENTS the convention silences the issue it names.
#   3. The keyword must sit on the SAME LINE as its ref. The separator is
#      `[ \t]*:?[ \t]*`, never `\s`, which spans newlines: `## Resolved` two
#      lines above a bare `#451` is not a close and must not read as one.
#   4. A comment strip that would swallow the body is REFUSED AND ANNOUNCED. A
#      stray `<!--` plus the template's trailing `-->` used to delete everything
#      between them, silencing every issue a PR named at once and leaving no
#      trace, since HTML comments render as nothing. Now the pattern refuses to
#      span a nested `<!--`, spans over COMMENT_MAX_SPAN are left in place, and
#      the finding carries `comment_strip_refused` with a stderr warning beside
#      it — a refusal a reader cannot see is the same false clean by a longer
#      route.
#
# Every one of those trades the same way on purpose: an over-broad suppression
# is a SILENT FALSE NEGATIVE — the exact failure this detector exists to end —
# while a missed suppression is a false positive a human dismisses in a second.
#
# The two arms keep SEPARATE ref regexes. Do not fold them into one: each arm
# has to be neuterable on its own for `scripts/test-stale-issues.sh` to
# mutation-prove it independently, and they are genuinely different questions —
# a title ref is already narrowed by `group_re`, while a body ref needs its own
# boundaries so `owner/repo#123` is not read as this repo's #123 and the hex
# colour `#7A3FE4` is not read as issue #7.

# GitHub's documented closing keywords, same-line-adjacent to the ref.
# The separator is its own constant so the gate can swap it for the
# newline-spanning `\s` form and prove the same-line rule is load-bearing.
# The colon branch owns its own trailing run, so there is only ONE way to split
# the whitespace before the `#`. The previous `[ \t]*:?[ \t]*` put two
# variable-length runs side by side and backtracked quadratically: measured
# 8000 -> 0.086s, 16000 -> 0.347s, 32000 -> 1.394s, 4x per doubling. Same

# Non-prose spans, blanked before the keyword scan only. Refs stay readable
# everywhere, because reporting one too many is the harmless direction.
# Fenced blocks and code spans are found by LINE/RUN SCANNERS, not regexes.
# Both regex forms backtracked super-linearly on untrusted bodies, and the first
# attempt to fix the fence was MEASURED WRONG. The original
# `(?P<fence>```+|~~~+).*?(?P=fence)` is O(n^3); the anchored replacement was
# still 5.227s on 13107 unclosed openers at GitHub's 65536-char cap, run twice
# per body across a `--limit 100` pull. The "0.0008s at 65536" recorded for it
# came from a newline-free backtick run — an input an anchored pattern rejects
# at the first character. That number described the INPUT, not the improvement.
# These scanners are 0.0115s on the same shape and linear on every shape tried.
#
# Anchoring had also narrowed the language: a CRLF closer and a closer longer
# than its opener (both CommonMark-legal, both handled by the ORIGINAL regex)
# stopped being masked, so a `Closes #N` inside such a block silently began
# suppressing again. The scanner handles both.
#
# The span scanner fixes a correctness hole the regex had all along:
# `` `[^`\n]*` `` pairs a DOUBLE backtick as an empty span, leaving the content
# of a ``like this`` span unmasked. The comment probe then read a `<!--` inside
# one as a real opener and swallowed the body. CommonMark 6.1 is the rule
# implemented here: an opening run of n backticks closes at the next run of
# EXACTLY n on the same line, and an unclosed run is literal text.

# children can be read for it. Build parent -> children from every issue in the
# repo, then report the OPEN parents whose children have ALL closed.
#
# The trailing (?![0-9]) is the PREFIX GUARD. Without a "the next character is
# not a digit" requirement, a match for parent #28 also claims every child of
# #283, and #28 gets reported complete on somebody else's finished work.
# GitHub's own text search has exactly that hole — it will not anchor `#28`
# against `#283` — which is why this is a body scan here and not a
# `--search "Part of #28"` query per candidate.

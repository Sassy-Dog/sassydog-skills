# queue-snapshot.sh — one-call read of the boardless fill/drain work queue.
#
# Replaces dispatch-ready's per-tick pair of ad-hoc `gh issue list` reads AND puts the
# parsing of the machine-readable body contracts in one place:
#   - `touches:` line   → the collision-avoidance file/dir set (issue #38)
#   - `Depends on #N`   → literal dependency lines
#   - `stack:` line     → a declared stacked-PR chain, bottom→top, carried on
#                         the BOTTOM issue and naming every member including
#                         itself. Distinct from `Depends on`: a dependency
#                         often means "later", a stack means "ship together".
#
# The execution site is read from LABELS, not from the body (issue #340, epic
# #322): a `site:<name>` label declares the workstation an issue can only be
# worked from, and no label means "any site".
#
# WHY A LABEL AND NOT A BODY LINE, which is the shape the three contracts above
# use. A body line can be QUOTED — an issue documenting the contract, or a
# template carrying an unfilled placeholder, would declare a site by accident.
# Preventing that means deciding what a fenced block, a code span, an HTML
# comment, an info string and their interactions mean, i.e. implementing a
# subset of CommonMark and discovering its edges one at a time. A label cannot
# be quoted in prose, so nothing needs masking and the whole class is gone. The
# three body contracts above are untouched by this and keep the raw-line parse
# they have always had.
#
# Site resolution, stated because a repo can carry more than one label and the
# answer must not depend on which:
#   * A label declares a site when its name starts with `site:`, matched
#     case-insensitively. Both halves of that carry weight and are pinned
#     separately: it is a PREFIX rather than a substring, so `offsite:x` and
#     `website` — which merely contain the text — declare nothing; and the
#     COLON is part of it, so `site-vdi` declares nothing either.
#   * The value is everything after that first colon, stripped and folded to
#     lowercase, so `Site: VDI` and `site:vdi` are one declaration and not two.
#   * A `site:` label with an EMPTY value declares nothing — there is no site
#     named "", and treating it as one would hold every issue carrying the bare
#     label.
#   * `sites` is the sorted set of declared values and is ALWAYS present. `[]`
#     means any site, one member means that site, and MORE THAN ONE IS A
#     CONFLICT this script does not resolve: it reports every declared value
#     and the reader's membership test settles it, so only a checkout NAMED
#     among them may take the issue. Never "any site" — narrowing, not
#     widening, is the whole point (issue #341).
#   * There is deliberately NO SCALAR beside it. A scalar is null both when
#     nothing is declared and when several things are, so its obvious reading —
#     `site is None or site == execution_site` — resolves a conflict to "any
#     site", which is the direction #322's originating bug ran: an unread
#     declaration letting the wrong loop claim the issue. The obvious reading
#     of the list, `not sites or execution_site.lower() in sites`, cannot
#     make that mistake. A shape that permits the wrong reading eventually
#     gets read that way, and prose spread across every consumer is not what
#     should be standing between a cold-worktree agent and that bug.
#   * THE READER FOLDS THE CONFIG SIDE. This script folds the label's value, so
#     the other half of the comparison is the consumer's and nothing here can
#     perform it: an `execution_site: VDI` matched raw against the folded `vdi`
#     holds the VDI loop's own work — the filter refusing exactly the checkout
#     it was written for. Write it `not sites or execution_site.lower() in
#     sites`, never plain equality against the raw config value (issue #341).
#   * THE RESOLUTION IS AVAILABLE TO CALLERS THAT ARE NOT READING A BUCKET:
#     `--sites-of` takes a JSON array of label names on stdin and prints the
#     resolved `sites` array, running no `gh` and touching no network. It exists
#     because the buckets are LABEL-SCOPED (`ready`, `in-progress`, `blocked`)
#     and two consumers legitimately hold labels from somewhere else — a board
#     card from `board-snapshot.sh`, and `take-it`'s `gh issue view` on an issue
#     nobody promoted (issue #341). Without it each of them writes its own
#     resolver, and the rules above stop having one answer; this is the
#     `taxonomy`-emitter shape CLAUDE.md already requires of a consumer, applied
#     to a resolver rather than a table. One `sites_of`, three callers.
#   * No character grammar is applied to the value. A label is created through
#     the GitHub UI or API by somebody with triage, is visible on the issue,
#     and cannot be edited into an issue body unnoticed — so the body-contract
#     defence a free-text field needs is not the right cost here. The rule for
#     whoever reports the value is unchanged: treat it as data, never
#     interpolate it into a command or a URL.
#
# Buckets:
#   ready     open + `ready` label, ordered number-ascending (oldest first)
#   in_flight open + `in-progress` label; assignee filter is reported, not
#             silently applied — each item carries its assignees and a `mine`
#             flag (true when @me is among them) so a drain tick can count its
#             own claims while still seeing other loops' claims
#   blocked   open + `blocked` label (numbers only)
#
# Judgment stays in the calling skill: touches-set intersection, priority
# ordering beyond issue number, and the smell test are prose contracts — this
# script only reads and parses.
#
# Usage: queue-snapshot.sh [--repo owner/name] [--limit 200]
#        queue-snapshot.sh --sites-of   (JSON array of label names on stdin)
# Env:   REPO=owner/name (fallback when --repo absent; else inferred from cwd)
#
# Output: single JSON object on stdout:
#   {"repo":"...","me":"login-or-null",
#    "ready":[{number,title,labels,assignees,sites,touches,stack,depends_on,unannotated}...],
#    "in_flight":[{number,title,labels,assignees,mine,sites,touches,stack}...],
#    "blocked":[N...]}
#   `--sites-of` instead prints one JSON array: the resolved sites, e.g.
#   `["site:vdi","ready"]` on stdin gives `["vdi"]`.
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok; 10 skipped (gh/python3 missing or no repo); 64 usage.
# Read-only.

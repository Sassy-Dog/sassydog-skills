CONFIG TEMPLATE: survey-work
Rendered into a consumer repo as .claude/sassy-dog/survey-work.md
  {{FACT}}          -> the detected + LIVE-VERIFIED value
  optional: blocks  -> omit the whole block when the repo lacks that surface.
                       Presence is the toggle. There is no `sentry: false` — the
                       confirmed-absent form is the scalar `none`, the contract's
                       one documented exception, and FOUR keys carry it:
                       `sentry: none`, `testflight: none`, `posthog: none`,
                       `mobile: none` (config-contract.md).
                       Omitted = nobody checked; `none` = somebody checked and
                       there is nothing there. The four are deliberately NOT
                       symmetric: only `sentry: none` still renders a blind-spot
                       row on the plate. Never default a `none` — it is written
                       only on an explicit answer (interview.md §2c), except
                       `sentry: none`, which records a failed culprit check.
  ## sections       -> carried across verbatim on refresh, never rewritten.
Drop this comment block from the rendered output. `---` must be line 1.

# optional — omit any block this repo does not have (`sentry:` only for a culprit-verified project — name similarity is not evidence; unverified renders `sentry: none`). For `sentry`/`testflight`/`posthog`/`mobile` the confirmed-absent alternative is the scalar `none` in place of the block

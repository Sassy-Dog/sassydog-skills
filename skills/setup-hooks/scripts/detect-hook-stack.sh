# --- tracked-file corpus (every path probe reads THIS, never its own pipeline)
# Manifest probes match by PATH REGEX over the tracked tree, not by git
# pathspec: a bare pathspec like 'pubspec.yaml' — or a `[ -f pubspec.yaml ]`
# test — matches only the repo ROOT, which silently reported "no dart" for
# every monorepo in the org (velovate keeps its Flutter app under
# apps/mobile/, so the render simply had no *.dart route and nothing errored).
# Anchor with (^|/) so packages/app/Cargo.toml counts and notcargo.toml does
# not. Same rule, same anchoring as setup-deps' detect-ecosystems.sh.
#
# A VENDORED EXAMPLE MANIFEST IS NOT A PROJECT. Scaffolder templates, test
# fixtures and sample projects commit real-looking manifests, so the corpus is
# filtered by VENDORED_RE before any probe runs — excluding by DIRECTORY NAME,
# not by depth, is what preserves the anchoring above (packages/web/Cargo.toml
# still counts, templates/Cargo.toml does not). Same exclusion list as
# detect-ecosystems.sh. A manifest found ONLY under an excluded path is
# reported in `why` and in detect_failures, so the filter is visible rather
# than silent.

# has_tracked <path-regex> — does the tracked tree hold a file matching it?
# Matches the corpus above with a herestring. THERE IS NO PIPELINE HERE, and
# that is the entire point: do not "simplify" this back to
# `git ls-files "<glob>" | head -1 | grep -q .`.
#
# That was the original shape, and under this script's `set -o pipefail` it
# INVERTS ITS OWN ANSWER ON LARGE REPOS (issue #172). `head -1`/`grep -q` exit
# on the first line; if the match list is bigger than the ~64KB pipe buffer the
# writer is still going, takes SIGPIPE, and pipefail hands the pipeline the
# writer's 141 — so a MATCH returns non-zero and READS AS A MISS, and the
# rendered hook silently drops that tool's route. Measured: it flips somewhere
# between 1000 and 2000 paths (~64KB of output), and `git ls-files "*"` in
# velovate's 2787-path tree exits 141 today. Size-dependent, so it is invisible
# in every small-repo test and wrong exactly where a wrong answer costs most —
# which is why scripts/test-detect-hook-stack.sh pins it against a 20k-path
# fixture and rejects any `| head` in this definition.
#
# ALL_TRACKED, not TRACKED_FILES: these probes have always counted vendored
# paths (a `*.sh` under examples/ still wants shellcheck). Narrowing them is a
# behaviour change, not part of this fix.

# the first match leaves the writer with SIGPIPE and the pipeline reports 141,

# the writer is still going, i.e. it under-detects the largest repos while every

# test-repo-signals-recovery.sh — pins how pull-repo-signals.sh answers
# `default_branch_ci`, what a SURVIVING null is allowed to mean, and what the
# recovered verdict must carry with it (issue #367).
#
# THE FAILURE. The puller took ONE unfiltered sample of the newest RUN_LIMIT
# workflow runs across ALL branches and derived a per-branch, per-event verdict
# from whatever happened to be in it. When that page held no push-class run on
# the default branch the verdict was null and the sweep had nothing to rank —
# velovate, brewslate, tailoredtip, what2wear and td3000, 5 of 15 org repos on
# 2026-09-06, tabulated in issue #367. It is silent in the way that matters
# most: null is well-formed JSON carrying no outcome, so a reader with no rule
# for it treats the repo as fine.
#
# THE RECOVERY, and the three filters a later simplification will drop. When the
# first derivation yields null the puller issues ONE narrow re-query,
# `--branch <default_branch> --event push --status completed --limit 1`. Each
# filter looks droppable for a DIFFERENT reason:
#
#   1. `--event` is the one that does the work, and a larger RUN_LIMIT is not a
#      substitute — velovate had ZERO push-on-main runs in its newest 100, so no
#      page size reaches it. The mock answers a branch-only query with the
#      `schedule` run that actually crowds a default branch, so dropping
#      `--event` reproduces the live null instead of being waved through.
#   2. `--status completed` is the one a reader assumes the derivation already
#      handles. It does — for the SAMPLE, which fetches RUN_LIMIT rows and can
#      walk past in-flight runs to the newest concluded one. This query fetches
#      exactly ONE row and has nothing to walk past, so without the filter a
#      single in-flight run re-creates the null the recovery exists to remove.
#      Row `recovery-skips-in-flight` runs against a pool whose NEWEST row is in
#      flight, which is the only shape that can tell the two apart.
#   3. `push` alone, never `push,merge_group`. A merge_group run's head branch
#      is `gh-readonly-queue/<branch>/pr-<N>`, so it can never satisfy
#      `--branch <default_branch>`; adding it widens the query and recovers
#      nothing. `merge-group-cannot-satisfy-branch` proves that premise against
#      the derivation rather than restating it.
#
#   sassydog-routines#46 shipped this with branch and status only and recovered
#   one repo of the two sampled; #47 added the event filter.
#
# THE OTHER TWO FLAGS ARE NOT DECORATION, and this gate pins all five because
# three of five left two ordinary edits green. A `--repo`-less `gh run list`
# resolves against the CWD repo, handing every repo in the org this repo's own
# verdict on the key `whats-on-fire` ranks and routes by — so the mock answers a
# `--repo`-less call the way `gh` would, as a different repository. Trimming
# `--json` to a shorter list makes the derivation reject every recovered run and
# silently reverts #367 — so the mock PROJECTS its answer through the requested
# field list rather than ignoring it, the same fidelity property
# test-queue-snapshot-site.sh treats as first-class.
#
# ONE DEFINITION IS NOT ONE ANSWER. The rule lives in
# derive_default_branch_ci() and is applied to both queries. Section 3 asserts
# the code form appears exactly once, but that is a SPELLING check and an
# inline copy worded differently slips past it — so the property is pinned
# behaviourally instead: mutant `ignoreevent` changes the shared rule and must
# redden a SAMPLE-path row and a RECOVERY-path row together. Nothing downstream
# can tell which query answered, which is why the two must not be able to
# disagree.
#
# THE STILL-NULL PATH IS THE POINT OF THE GATE. A recovery that works is easy to
# see; a null that survives it is not, and it is what `scoring.md`'s unknown
# state is built on. `default_branch_runs_seen` is THREE-STATE for the same
# reason `dependabot.enabled` is, and every state has its own row:
#
#   * `0` — READ, and there is no such run (`still-null-empty`). This is a
#     positive claim and may only come from a recovery that actually answered.
#   * non-zero with a null verdict — they are all still in flight
#     (`still-null-all-in-flight`, and `failed-recovery-keeps-probe` for the
#     case where the recovery could not confirm it).
#   * `null` — the recovery could not be read (`unreadable-recovery-is-unknown`)
#     or came back in a shape the derivation cannot reduce
#     (`underivable-recovery-is-unknown`). Collapsing either into `0` re-creates
#     the original defect one level up: `scoring.md` renders `0` as the sentence
#     "there is no default-branch run", which would then be asserted about a 503.
#
#   A sample count of ZERO is not evidence and contributes nothing to the merge;
#   a sample that DID see runs bounds the count from below, so a one-row recovery
#   cannot shrink it (`still-null-all-in-flight`).
#
# THE VERDICT SHIPS ITS AGE. The recovery is unbounded by RUN_LIMIT — in #367's
# own table it reached back to 2026-08-09 for two of five repos, measured
# 2026-09-06 — so a verdict rendered without its age turns five `CI unknown`
# repos into `✓ Clean today` on a month-old run, which is quieter than the
# missing verdict it replaced. `default_branch_ci_age_days` and
# `default_branch_ci_url` therefore travel with the verdict from the SAME run,
# on both paths (`sample-verdict-age`, `recovered-verdict-age`,
# `recovered-verdict-url`). The url matters on its own: `last_failure` is
# derived from the sample, so a recovered failure has none beside it.
#
# MUTATION PROOF, with the MEMBERSHIP half. The matrix is a function of the
# script path, so it is re-run against fifteen mutated copies. Reach is DERIVED
# from the verdicts, and each mutant additionally declares the row it MUST
# redden — because reddened sets overlap, and without membership "the recovery
# does not exist" and "`--event` is not load-bearing" produce indistinguishable
# red builds. Same shape as test-site-filter.sh and test-queue-snapshot-site.sh.
# The rows no mutant reaches must equal the declared set, which holds exactly
# the two fixture-adequacy preconditions.
#
# NO NETWORK, STRUCTURALLY. The shim's resolution is verified immediately after
# `chmod` and EXITS if PATH did not pick it up — a failed chmod or a noexec
# $TMPDIR otherwise sends every read to the operator's real, authenticated `gh`,
# and `mock-org` is a real GitHub organization (issue #348). The mock honouring
# `--json` is a FIDELITY property and is not a second guard.

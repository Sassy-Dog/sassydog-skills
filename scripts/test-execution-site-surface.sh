# test-execution-site-surface.sh — pins the HUMAN-FACING half of the
# execution-site contract (issue #343, epic #322): `groom-backlog`'s rubric #9,
# the `survey-work` plate's backlog lines, and `setup-config`'s interview
# question for `execution_site`.
#
# The machine half is gated elsewhere and nothing here re-tests it:
# test-queue-snapshot-site.sh covers the parser (#340), test-site-filter.sh the
# two dispatchers that consume it (#341). This gate covers the prose that tells
# a human, and a cold sub-agent, what to DO with the value — the surface no
# parser test can reach.
#
# THE SHAPE OF THE BUG IT GUARDS. Four decisions here read like drift to a later
# "align this with its siblings" sweep, and every one is load-bearing:
#
#   1. THE DECLARATION IS A LABEL, AND GROOMING NEVER WRITES A BODY LINE. It
#      sits beside three body contracts that grooming DOES write (`touches:`,
#      `Depends on #N`, `stack:`), so "add a `site:` line while you are in
#      there" is the natural-looking edit. #340 shipped the body form first and
#      withdrew it: a raw line can be quoted, and both issues introducing the
#      contract carried a fenced example that declared a site by accident. A
#      label cannot be quoted in prose.
#   2. AN UNLABELLED ISSUE RENDERS EXACTLY AS IT DID BEFORE. The obvious
#      "improvement" is a token on every backlog line — `(any site)` — which
#      grows noise proportional to the backlog to say nothing, and buries the
#      handful of lines that carry a real one.
#   3. SEVERAL `site:` LABELS NARROW, AND ARE NEVER "ANY SITE". Every named
#      checkout may take the issue and membership is the whole test (#341), so
#      neither surface refuses a multi-member declaration, reports it as
#      dispatchable nowhere, or tidies it down to one — removing a label strips
#      the issue from a checkout the declaration named, and nothing reports
#      that. The reading to refuse is the opposite one: resolving several
#      declarations into "any site" re-creates #322's originating bug with two
#      labels instead of zero. THIS DECISION REPLACED ITS OWN INVERSE. Before
#      #341 the contract said several labels "match no checkout", both surfaces
#      said so, and this gate pinned it; section 5 now bans the retired wording
#      outright so the two rewrites cannot drift back one file at a time.
#   4. THE PLATFORM PROPOSES; THE USER NAMES. The interview offers a default and
#      never writes one — an unanswered question leaves the key ABSENT, and
#      absent means "any site". `vdi` carries a meaning no platform string does.
#
# NEITHER SURFACE RESOLVES LABELS ITSELF. Both run
# `queue-snapshot.sh --sites-of`, because neither read is a bucket — the buckets
# are label-scoped and these two list open issues and grooming candidates. A
# paraphrase forks the rules, measured: one dropped the `strip()` and answered
# `" vdi"` for a label the script calls legal.
#
# WHY THE INTERVIEW MUST NOT COPY THE PLATFORM TABLE. `config-contract.md` owns
# the `uname -s` → proposed-name mapping. A second copy is a copy that drifts,
# and this one has a known drift DIRECTION: an earlier draft of #343 wrote
# `darwin` / `win32` — a language runtime's platform constants, which no
# `uname -s` ever emits. So section 4 asserts the table's tokens ABSENT from the
# three consumer files, CASE-INSENSITIVELY and including `win32`: a
# case-sensitive ban catches a faithful copy and admits the lowercase
# runtime-constant form, which is the one this repo has actually written.
# The same pattern is first pointed at the table's home, so a matcher that
# matches nothing fails loudly instead of reporting a clean tree.
#
# WHY THE INTERVIEW IS CONFINED TO THE THREE ONE-TIME MODES. A refresh runs
# again and again, so a proposal made there is re-offered forever; create,
# migrate and adopt run once per repo, so declining once is a decline that
# sticks. That is the ONLY mechanism recording a "declined" — the key has no
# `none` form (config-contract.md excludes it from the confirmed-absent set) —
# which is why section 6 bans the three pre-#343 sentences saying the interview
# does not exist yet, each proved non-vacuous against the exact sentence it
# retired, and why the migrate row pins the ASK rather than the mere mention of
# §3d: a migrate path that stops asking leaves every migrated repo with no offer
# ever, while a gate reading only the section name goes on reporting it as
# asking.
#
# Must-exist assertions run on a WHITESPACE-FLATTENED copy: this repo hard-wraps
# prose, so a line-scoped grep turns a wrap into a false miss. Same
# normalisation as test-doc-reconciliation.sh.
#
# THE MUTANTS RUN HERE, AND THEIR REACH IS DERIVED. The first edition of this
# gate carried the roster in a scratch file and this header claimed "41
# mutations, every one reddens the row naming it" — a claim nothing re-computed,
# which is exactly the shape test-queue-snapshot-site.sh paid three review
# rounds for. It was also false as a standing property the moment a row was
# re-anchored. So the gate now RUNS ITSELF against each mutated copy of the
# subject files (`EXEC_SITE_SRC` moves every subject path, `EXEC_SITE_CHILD`
# suppresses the recursion), diffs the failing-row set against a baseline that
# must be clean, and checks two things against that derived set: the row a
# mutant names is a MEMBER of it, and the rows NO mutant reddens are exactly the
# declared `UNPINNED_ROWS`, which is empty. A row nothing can redden proves
# nothing, and this makes that state impossible to add quietly. Copies only;
# nothing under the tracked tree is written at any point.
#
# FOUR ROWS WENT VACUOUS BEFORE THE HARNESS EXISTED, and the pattern is worth
# carrying to any row added here.
#   * THREE MATCHED PROSE THEY DO NOT GOVERN. 'out of the top 5' is what the
#     blind-spots rule already says about a dark surface; 'skipped on a refresh'
#     is §2c's phrase, and §2c says the OPPOSITE; 'only issues this checkout can
#     take' appears twice in the plate, so deleting the rule left the sample
#     block's comment matching. In a repo whose surfaces all discuss ranking,
#     refreshes and checkouts, a plausible-sounding phrase is very often already
#     present somewhere else, and a row that matches it is decoration.
#   * ONE WAS A BAN NARROWER THAN THE CLAIM IT RETIRED. Section 5 banned
#     `matches no checkout`; a mutant wrote "several labels MATCH no checkout"
#     and walked through. The first fix, `matches?`, was ALSO wrong and still
#     passed, because `?` binds to the preceding character: that reads "matche"
#     plus an optional "s", never the bare verb. The third still admitted
#     `matched by no checkout`, `matching no checkout` and `no checkout
#     matches`. A ban is only as wide as the INFLECTIONS of the claim it
#     retires, an English rewrite reaches for all of them, and nothing but a
#     mutant writing another spelling finds this — so every inflection carries
#     its own proof string.

# --- 5. the retired "matches no checkout" semantics stay retired --------------
#
# Until #341 the contract said several `site:` labels match no checkout, and
# both surfaces said so — grooming refused Ready, the plate called the issue
# undispatchable. #341 settled the opposite: membership NARROWS, and every named
# checkout may take the issue. Two files were rewritten, so the failure mode is
# one drifting back alone; the proofs are the sentence each file actually
# carried, plus every inflection an English rewrite reaches for.

# FOURTH WIDENING. Every proof below used to put "match" ADJACENT to "no
# checkout", so the self-proof above could not expose the gap: a MODAL is the
# most natural way a later editor restates a retired rule, and "no checkout
# WILL match" / "no checkout CAN match" both shipped green. So did the
# quantifier forms — "matches none of the checkouts", "matches neither
# checkout" — and the `site` spelling of the same claim. The window is bounded
# to one sentence (`[^.]`) so the alternation cannot reach across a full stop
# into unrelated prose.
# FIFTH WIDENING, and it closes an asymmetry INSIDE the fourth. Branches 1 and 2
# accepted `checkout|site`; branch 3 accepted only `checkout`, so "matches none
# of the sites" and "matches neither site" walked straight through. Both
# branches also demanded the noun ADJACENT to "no", so any adjective between
# them — "no valid checkout", "no eligible site", "no configured checkout" —
# escaped as well (all five measured green against the old pattern, issue #353).

# --- 5b. the three decisions this gate shipped without covering ---------------
#
# All three were measured green under a verbatim revert (issue #353): the gate
# reached 40 rows while leaving the highest-consequence rule it documents, the
# decision the LAST review had to catch by hand, and the only repo-scoped write
# in this skill entirely unpinned.

# THE SILENT ONE. Every other rule here fails loudly when it is broken; this one
# fails by promoting site-held work to Ready and reporting success, because a
# resolver that could not run prints exactly what an unlabelled issue prints.
# groom-backlog names that consequence in its own words, so the row pins the
# instruction rather than the rationale: an instruction survives a rewrite of
# the reasoning around it, and it is the half a cold agent acts on.

# THE ONE A HUMAN CAUGHT. Rubric #9 creates a label in the REPOSITORY, which is
# the only write in this skill that an issue edit cannot reverse — and the
# frontmatter said "issue-body edits, Ready promotion, epic-split sub-issues"
# and stopped. Both halves are load-bearing and neither implies the other: the
# declaration is what a reader of the skill list sees, the §1 prose is what the
# agent about to write reads.

# THE WRITE PATH ITSELF, whose two failures the prose calls already-paid-for and
# nothing checked: `gh label list` bounded at 30 under CREATION order, so the
# freshly created label is exactly what a truncated read misses; and a `|| true`
# that swallows the create, which is the silent no-op test-label-taxonomy.sh
# exists because of. The third is newer and worse: `--force` recolours the
# existing label repo-wide, reached by trying to be tidy about an error that was
# already the answer.

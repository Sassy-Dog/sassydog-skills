#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-plugin-root-in-references.sh — bans `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` from commands
# in reference docs, and requires the variable that replaces it to be resolvable
# (issue #329).
#
# Why this exists: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is substituted into `SKILL.md` at
# load time and NOWHERE else. A reference doc is read raw, and the token is not
# an environment variable, so a command line carrying it runs against `/`:
#
#     $ bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/pr-shepherd/scripts/teardown.sh --sweep
#     bash: /skills/pr-shepherd/scripts/teardown.sh: No such file or directory
#
# That fails loudly (127), which bounds the severity — but the cost is an agent
# hitting a dead end in a document it was told to follow, whose likeliest
# recovery is improvising a path. Thirteen such lines accumulated across six
# docs, nine of them in `pr-shepherd`, the capability skill `send-it`,
# `take-it` and `dispatch-ready` all delegate merge mechanics to.
#
# Why a gate rather than a memo: NOTHING fails when a reference doc writes the
# token raw. CLAUDE.md already documented the rule in prose and the tree
# drifted to thirteen violations anyway — the repo's own convention ("a rule
# stated in prose with no gate rots silently") applied to itself.
#
# The whole difficulty is the exception. `skills/assess-it/references/
# github-issue-ops.md` names the token in PROSE to document this exact trap and
# its remedy; that line is correct and load-bearing. A guard keyed on mere
# presence deletes the one doc that explains the bug. The distinction encoded
# here is COMMAND USAGE vs prose, and it maps exactly onto fenced code blocks:
# at the time of writing all 13 offending sites were inside ```fences``` and the
# prose exception was not. That is why property 2 exists as a fixture — it
# fails the moment the scanner degrades into matching everything.
#
# Four properties are asserted:
#
#   1. Tree-level: no `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` appears inside a fenced code
#      block in any `skills/*/references/*.md`.
#   2. The prose exception is still present AND still unflagged. Both halves
#      matter: presence keeps the remedy documented, unflagged proves the
#      scanner discriminates rather than matching every occurrence.
#   3. Any reference doc whose commands use `$PLUGIN_ROOT` carries the
#      path-resolution preamble that tells the reader to set it. This is the
#      property with teeth — swapping an unresolvable token for an unset
#      variable is the SAME bug wearing a different name, and it is the shape a
#      later cleanup will reach for. A doc that uses the variable without
#      defining where it comes from fails here.
#   4. Mutation proof, both directions, against scratch fixtures: a newly-added
#      raw command-usage site IS caught, and a prose mention is NOT. Without
#      this a scanner that silently matched nothing would sit green forever.
#
# Source-level only: no gh, no network, no repo mutation. Fixtures are scratch
# files under mktemp, scanned by the SAME function that scans the tree — a
# second implementation would let the two drift.
#
# Wired into scripts/preflight.sh; run directly:
#   bash scripts/test-plugin-root-in-references.sh

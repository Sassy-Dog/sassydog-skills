#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-site-filter.sh — the two CONSUMERS of the execution-site declaration:
# dispatch-ready §4's Site filter and take-it's refusal before the claim
# (issue #341, epic #322). #340 put the declaration on the issue — a
# `site:<name>` label, resolved by `queue-snapshot.sh` into a per-issue `sites`
# array — and gated that. Nothing read it. This gate is the other half.
#
# WHY THE CONSUMER IS THE HALF THAT MATTERS, and why it is a HOLD rather than a
# recovery. The costs are asymmetric: a mis-groom is recoverable, a human sees
# the wrong column and moves the card. A wrong dispatch is not. The laptop loop
# claims the issue, moves it to In progress, spends a worktree agent that cannot
# reach the VDI's artifacts or clusters, records `attempt 1 failed`, and on the
# next tick lands the issue in `blocked` under a comment naming the wrong cause.
# So the mismatch is stepped around BEFORE the claim, never discovered after an
# agent has burned an attempt on it.
#
# THE FIVE DECISIONS PINNED HERE, each of which reads to a later sweep like
# something to tidy:
#
#   1. THE MATCH IS THE ARRAY FORM, FOLDED ON BOTH SIDES:
#      `not sites or execution_site.lower() in sites`. The array read is the
#      only one that cannot resolve an ambiguous declaration to "any site" — a
#      scalar is null both for "nothing declared" and for "several declared",
#      so `site is None or site == execution_site` widens a conflict into the
#      unconstrained case, which is the direction #322's originating bug ran.
#      The FOLD is two-sided and only one side is somebody else's: the snapshot
#      folds the label's value, and folding the configured value is the reading
#      skill's half. Written as raw equality, a repo configured
#      `execution_site: VDI` holds the VDI loop's own work — the filter
#      refusing precisely the checkout it was written for. EVERY subject is held
#      to one spelling, and the subjects are the `SUBJECTS` list below. Before
#      #341 the three that existed disagreed — `queue-snapshot.sh`'s header and
#      `config-contract.md` unfolded, `github-issues/SKILL.md` folded — which is
#      how a two-sided rule rots into a one-sided one with nothing failing.
#
#   2. THE DISCRIMINATION HALF IS LOAD-BEARING. A filter that holds everything
#      satisfies "site-mismatched work is held" and is useless. So `sites == []`
#      proceeding exactly as today, and a `sites` CONTAINING this checkout's
#      site proceeding however many members it carries, are pinned as their own
#      rows in BOTH consumers. Membership narrows; it never widens. take-it's
#      membership bullet is the one a reader adds LAST and the one whose absence
#      is quietest: with only the empty-case bullet beside it, "several labels
#      are a conflict, so refuse" reads as the obvious completion and
#      contradicts the folded membership match stated two paragraphs above it.
#
#   3. AN UNNAMED CHECKOUT IS FAIL-OPEN, AND IT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM AN
#      UNLABELLED ISSUE. With no `execution_site` configured the filter does not
#      run at all — an absent key means the repo has not adopted sites, and
#      holding every site-labelled issue in a repo that never opted in breaks
#      drains that work today. The two directions fail opposite ways on purpose
#      (an unnamed checkout ignores every declaration; a declaration-free issue
#      is taken by every checkout), so each gets its own row. Collapsing them
#      into one "absent means unconstrained" sentence is the tidy to refuse:
#      whichever half is dropped goes dark, and neither is evidence for the
#      other.
#
#   4. A SITE HOLD IS NOT A FAILURE. It costs NO redispatch budget, triggers NO
#      demotion, and writes no `attempt 1 failed` comment. Spending the budget
#      on it is exactly how the issue arrives at `blocked` under a comment
#      naming the wrong cause — the bug this filter exists to prevent, wearing
#      the filter's own face. take-it's mirror of that is ORDER: the refusal is
#      raised before §4 runs, so no assignee and no `in-progress` label is ever
#      written for work this checkout cannot do. Order is not assertable from
#      prose alone, so it is checked as a line-number comparison against the
#      claim step's own heading.
#
#   5. ONE RESOLVER, AND EVERY CONSUMER RUNS IT. `queue-snapshot.sh`'s buckets
#      are LABEL-SCOPED, so two legitimate callers hold labels the buckets never
#      saw: dispatch-ready's `board:` path, whose `board-snapshot.sh` emits
#      `labels` and no `sites` at all, and take-it on an issue nobody promoted to
#      Ready. Left with a ban on re-deriving and no emitter to call, each writes
#      its own resolver or skips the filter — and skipping it is a SILENT
#      FAIL-OPEN in a repo that explicitly opted in, which is #322's bug under
#      prose that reads as protected. `--sites-of` is the answer, and it is the
#      `taxonomy`-emitter shape CLAUDE.md already requires of a consumer applied
#      to a resolver: rows here run it rather than describing it, because the
#      paraphrase that preceded it dropped `.strip()` and answered `" vdi"` for
#      a label the header calls legal.
#
# WHAT THIS GATE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not re-check #340's
# resolution rules (prefix, colon, folding, empty value, conflict) — those are
# `scripts/test-queue-snapshot-site.sh`'s, measured against the emitter with a
# mock `gh`. Duplicating them here would be the third-copy shape this repo
# refuses; the two behavioural rows below check that `--sites-of` REACHES that
# resolver and reaches nothing else, never what the resolver decides. It also
# asserts nothing about §7's terminal states beyond the pointer §4 owes an
# operator: a drain whose only remaining Ready items are site holds still ends
# STALLED after this, which is a separate child of #322, and
# `scripts/test-drain-terminal-states.sh` owns that section.
#
# NEEDLES ARE PINNED THROUGH THEIR TERMINATOR, NOT AS BARE SUBSTRINGS. A
# must-exist row matching `costs no redispatch budget` is satisfied by
# `costs no redispatch budget ON THE FIRST HOLD AND ONE ATTEMPT ON EVERY LATER
# ONE` — measured, that inversion passed every row while decision 4 was gone.
# Deletion mutants cannot see it either, because the phrase they delete is still
# there. So the rows carrying a decision match the whole clause up to its
# terminator, and each has a QUALIFICATION mutant beside its deletion one.
#
# THE MUTANTS' REACH IS DERIVED, NEVER WRITTEN DOWN. This is the lesson
# test-queue-snapshot-site.sh paid for three review rounds running: a
# hand-written roster claiming which mutant reddens which row is a claim
# nothing re-computes, and three of its rows went vacuous under one. So the
# gate RUNS ITSELF against each mutated tree, diffs the failing-row set against
# a baseline that must be empty, and checks two things against that derived
# flip set — that the row a mutant names is a MEMBER of it, and that the rows
# NO mutant flips are exactly the declared `UNPINNED_ROWS`. A row nothing can
# redden proves nothing, and this makes that state impossible to add quietly.
#
# A VETO NEEDS A MUTANT THAT ONLY IT CAN CATCH. The two whole-subject vetoes
# were reachable at first only as COLLATERAL of mutants that wrote the offending
# text inside a window some must-exist row already covered — so narrowing either
# veto's haystack back to one window left the gate green with an empty unpinned
# set. Each now has a mutant writing the text OUTSIDE every window a `row_has`
# reads, which is the only edit that distinguishes a whole-subject veto from a
# windowed one.
#
# HOW THE SELF-RUN IS BOUND, because a child that measured the wrong tree would
# report an empty flip set for every mutant and the roster would fail loudly
# rather than pass — but only if the child ran at all. `SITE_FILTER_SRC` moves
# every subject path and nothing else; the child is run FIRST against the
# tracked tree and must exit 0 having emitted every declared row, which is what
# proves the harness before any verdict is read from it. `SITE_FILTER_CHILD`
# suppresses the mutation section so the recursion is exactly one level deep.
# Mutating COPIES rather than the tracked files is deliberate here and is not
# the #262 trap: the trap is a harness that mutates a copy while the assertions
# read the tracked file, and here the child reads the copies by construction.
# Nothing under the tracked tree is written at any point.
#
# THE WINDOW GUARD IS A SEPARATE READ FROM THE WINDOW. `raw_region` stops
# BEFORE printing its stop line, so grepping the window for that stop line can
# never fail — the first edition did exactly that and called it an overrun
# guard. Reproduced: renaming `## 5. Dispatch` grew §4 to EOF and the run still
# exited 0 with every row green. The stop is now proved present in the FILE
# after the start line, and a guard mutant renames one and requires the child to
# abort loudly rather than to flip a row.
#
# Source-level plus two behavioural rows against `--sites-of`; seven tracked
# files (the `SUBJECTS` list), copies only, no `gh` and no network.

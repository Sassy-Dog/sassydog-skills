# align-labels.sh — the canonical home of the ENGINEERING-DIMENSION + SEVERITY
# label taxonomy. The 14 labels, their colours and their descriptions are
# defined in the CANONICAL_LABELS table below, nowhere else. Point it at a repo
# and it creates what is missing and corrects what has drifted.
#
# TWO LABEL TAXONOMIES LIVE IN THIS PLUGIN. THEY ARE DISJOINT BY DESIGN — do
# NOT "unify" them:
#
#   1. This script — engineering dimensions + severity. Ambient classification:
#      what an issue is ABOUT and how bad it is. Long-lived, repo-wide, applied
#      by humans and by assess-it. assess-it INVOKES this script against the
#      repo it is auditing (skills/assess-it/SKILL.md phase 4); it used to carry
#      its own transcription of the table, which froze at the pre-#158 colours
#      and re-created the very collision #158 removed, in every repo it audited
#      (issue #167). A consumer of this taxonomy runs this script or reads
#      `taxonomy` — it never copies the rows.
#   2. skills/github-issues/scripts/issue-claim.sh (plus the --ensure-label of
#      file-or-link-issue.sh) — the dev-workflow STATE labels `ready`,
#      `in-progress`, `blocked`, `sentry-escalation`. Those are ensure-created
#      at the moment of the state transition that needs them, with canonical
#      colour and description, and MUST NOT appear in the table below: two
#      definitions of one label is exactly the drift both scripts exist to
#      prevent. RESERVED_LABELS asserts it at startup rather than trusting the
#      next editor to remember.
#
# Dependabot's per-ecosystem labels (`javascript`, `github_actions`, `rust`,
# `dart`, …) are auto-created and correctly differ per repo. Not our business.
#
# SCOPE — two passes, and only one of them can ever destroy anything:
#
#   ALIGN (the default pass). Ensures the canonical labels EXIST with canonical
#   definitions. It never deletes a label and never touches an issue.
#
#   MIGRATE (--migrate <file>, issue #163). Folds a repo's one-off labels onto
#   the canonical set: add the new label to every issue carrying the old one,
#   then delete the old label. Deleting a label strips it from every issue
#   carrying it, UNRECOVERABLY — so relabel comes first, delete second, and
#   that ordering is enforced structurally rather than by convention. See THE
#   DELETE GATE below. Mappings are data (a file), never a flag per mapping.
#
# THE DELETE GATE. `gh label delete` has exactly ONE call site in this script:
# inside migrate_delete_gate(). That function's own body issues a FRESH
# `gh issue list` for the old label and returns without deleting on every path
# that is not "zero issues still carry the old label without the new one". The
# relabel loop's counters are not an input to it and are never consulted — the
# migration's own success message is not evidence. A delete is therefore
# unreachable except through a re-query performed immediately before it, in the
# same function body, so a `set -e` gap, a stray `|| true`, or a reordering
# elsewhere in the script cannot route around it. scripts/test-label-migrate.sh
# asserts that single-call-site invariant against this file's source, and
# proves the gate is load-bearing by neutering it and watching the withheld
# delete fire.
#
# What migrate mode deliberately does NOT do:
#   * delete a label that has no mapping. Every delete here is the tail of a
#     verified relabel; a label with no target has signal to lose and no
#     evidence to gate on, so it stays a human decision (issue #159).
#   * relabel pull requests. The migration is about issue signal and
#     `gh issue list` excludes PRs, so a PR carrying a migrated-away label
#     loses it when the label is deleted. Known, accepted, and small.
#   * create a target label. A mapping whose TARGET is absent from the repo is
#     held back rather than invented — run the align pass first.
#
# Usage:
#   align-labels.sh [--repo owner/name] [--dry-run | --check | --collisions]
#   align-labels.sh [--repo owner/name] --migrate <file> [--dry-run]
#   align-labels.sh taxonomy
#
#   taxonomy     print the table as `name|color|description` lines and exit.
#                Needs no gh, no jq and no repo: it is how OTHER tools read this
#                taxonomy without forking a second copy of the values — the
#                mirror of issue-claim.sh's `taxonomy`, which this script's
#                cross-set check already consumes (issue #167).
#   --repo       target repo; defaults to the current repo via `gh repo view`.
#   --dry-run    preview: report what would change, write nothing. Exit 0.
#   --check      drift report: same read-only pass, but exit 3 when the repo is
#                out of alignment — the gateable form for an audit sweep. Also
#                runs the cross-set colour check below.
#   --collisions cross-set colour check ONLY. Compares this table against the
#                dev-workflow taxonomy and exits 3 if any pair is closer than
#                CROSS_SET_MIN_DE. Definitions only: no repo, no gh, no
#                network — the form scripts/preflight.sh gates CI on.
#   --migrate    run the MIGRATE pass over the old -> new mappings in <file>
#                ("-" reads stdin). Mutually exclusive with --check and
#                --collisions. Combine with --dry-run for a full preview.
#
# Mapping file format — one mapping per line, `<repo>|<old>|<new>`:
#
#     # comments and blank lines are ignored; field whitespace is trimmed
#     Sassy-Dog/velovate|priority:p1|sev:critical
#     Sassy-Dog/qr-ninja|supply-chain|security
#
#   One file describes the whole plan and each run processes only the lines
#   whose repo matches the resolved --repo, so the same file drives all 14
#   repos. The WHOLE file is validated before any network call: a mapping
#   touching a reserved dev-workflow label, a duplicated source, a chained
#   mapping (a -> b alongside b -> c in one repo, where the result depends on
#   evaluation order), old == new, or a malformed line each exit 64.
#
# Env: DRY_RUN=1 equivalent to --dry-run. REPO honored if --repo absent.
#      ISSUE_LIMIT overrides the per-mapping issue-read ceiling (default 1000).
#
# Output: one JSON line per canonical label on stdout for the align pass:
#   {"label":"security","action":"ok|create|update|would-create|would-update|failed","detail":"..."}
# and one JSON line per mapping for the migrate pass:
#   {"mapping":"old -> new","old":"..","new":"..","relabeled":N,
#    "action":"migrated|would-migrate|already-migrated|held-back|blocked|failed","detail":"..."}
# Human-readable summary goes to stderr.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  — aligned (or applied successfully, or --dry-run preview)
#   1  — missing tooling (gh/jq), no repo, or the label read failed
#   2  — at least one write failed (the pass CONTINUES past failures)
#   3  — --check: drift found (nothing was written), or a cross-set colour
#        collision; --collisions: a cross-set colour collision
#   4  — --migrate: at least one mapping was HELD BACK — its old label was not
#        deleted. Outranks 2, because a partial relabel usually produces both
#        and the withheld delete is the outcome an operator must act on; the
#        failing writes are still listed on stderr and in the JSON either way.
#   64 — usage error, or an invalid mapping file (refused before any network
#        call)
#
# Idempotent by construction: a second align run against an aligned repo finds
# every label already matching and issues no gh write at all, and a second
# migrate run finds every old label already gone and issues none either.
#
# COLOURS ARE LORE — three sit deliberately off their modal palette value so
# chips stay distinguishable, and re-"tidying" them reintroduces a collision:
#   security  ee0701  (was identical to sev:critical)
#   tech-debt c5def5  (was identical to sev:medium)
#   epic      3e4b9e  (was identical to sev:low AND to ready)
# `infra` joined the set in 2026-08 and its colour was picked by measurement,
# not by eye: 5f4811 is the maximum-separation point of a 1,440-colour sweep,
# min ΔE2000 = 28.9 against every label that can share a chip row with it (the
# other 13 canonical labels, the four dev-workflow labels above, and GitHub's
# default set) — versus 5.3 for the tightest pair already inside the canonical
# set. It must NOT reuse c5def5, the colour the pre-canonical `infra` carried
# in three repos, because that is tech-debt's.
#
# EACH TAXONOMY USED TO VALIDATE ONLY AGAINST ITSELF, and four cross-set pairs
# sat at ΔE2000 = 0 as a result (issue #161): ready/sev:low,
# in-progress/architecture, blocked/sev:critical and
# sentry-escalation/sev:critical each shared a hex exactly, while every
# dispatchable issue carries one label from each set. The dev-workflow side
# moved; `--collisions` is what stops it happening again, and it reads the
# other taxonomy from its owner (`issue-claim.sh taxonomy`) rather than
# carrying a copy of it — a copy is the fork this split exists to prevent.

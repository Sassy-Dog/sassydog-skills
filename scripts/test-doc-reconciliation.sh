#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-doc-reconciliation.sh — pins the doc-reconciliation step in all THREE
# shipping paths (issue #220).
#
# What the shipping-path checks are NOT. They do not decide whether arbitrary
# prose is actually stale. #220 rules that out: staleness is a semantic
# judgement about whether a sentence still describes the code, there is nothing
# to grep for, and a script pretending otherwise would produce exactly the
# skimmed-past output issue #199 documents for the reference checker. This gate
# gates the INSTRUCTION's presence, the same source-level shape as
# test-visibility-preconditions.sh and test-sentry-counts.sh.
#
# The bug it guards. Nothing in the shipping path asked whether a change had
# just made a doc wrong. Lint, type, test and the review agent all pass on a PR
# whose CLAUDE.md now states the opposite of what the repo does, because docs
# are an input to no other gate. One Solador PR shipped beside three doc claims
# that were already false before it started — a "not consumed" value that had
# been reaching the host cards for a while, a "hard-coded" version that was the
# git-derived CalVer, and a "no release train yet" line pointing at a closed
# issue whose release.yml ships macOS and Windows. All three were caught by a
# human noticing.
#
# Why all three skills, and why take-it/dispatch-ready are the important half:
# those dispatch SUB-AGENTS that open their own PRs from a cold worktree. They
# never see an interactive session's CLAUDE.md, so a rule that lives only in
# send-it never runs for them. #220 calls this "the half most likely to be
# missed" — so the gate treats the three as equals and fails if any one lacks
# it.
#
# Four things are pinned:
#
#   1. All three skills carry the step.
#   2. In send-it it runs BEFORE the PR body is drafted. The body is where "what
#      changed" is stated, so a doc fix belongs in the same PR, not a follow-up.
#   3. Both traps survive, with their reasons:
#        - issue state is not evidence (closed != landed, open != not landed)
#        - claims of deliberate absence rot silently
#      These are the two that produced real errors, and they are the sentences a
#      later trim reads as belt-and-braces.
#   4. The scope limiter survives ("the area you touched", not every markdown
#      file). Without it the step is unbounded, and an unbounded step is skipped.
#
# Must-not-exist assertions run on a WHITESPACE-FLATTENED copy: this repo
# hard-wraps prose, and a line-scoped grep turns a wrap into a false PASS.
#
# The structural exceptions are derivable: section 6 reconciles the gate count,
# and section 7 compares setup-config's complete template applicability inventory
# with its tracked template roster and actual nested frontmatter slots (#380).
# Missing review_site was only the first measured gap: board subfields and
# conditional site/stack/migration inputs were also missing. Checking file-wide
# mentions would accept prose about a key no template could emit.
#
# The contract's per-skill inventory is the only applicability list. The checker
# reads its always-written, conditional and hand-set columns, including unchanged
# tidy-repo; it does not duplicate the list or create a general schema validator.
# It scans the templates' simple mapping syntax, skips folded/literal scalar
# contents, and stops at the closing frontmatter fence. Template # optional
# boundaries distinguish slots that must survive omission from opt-ins.
# Hand-set review_surfaces deliberately has NO generated slot; this is not a
# rendered-config validator and must not reject a user's map or a legal omission
# of review_agent. Product-surface none alternatives remain owned by the Sentry
# gates. A skill invocation still has to prove actual rendering and consent.
#
# In-memory negative specimens exercise the same comparison as the live files:
# removed review_site/site/stack/migration slots, a nested board-field omission,
# keys moved into prose/comments/block scalars, an always-written key made
# optional, an invented hand-set slot, and template/inventory roster drift.
# Each must fail for its named path or roster mismatch, not an unrelated error.
# No gh or network; all subjects are tracked and no specimen writes to the tree.
#
# Wired into scripts/preflight.sh; run directly:
#   bash scripts/test-doc-reconciliation.sh

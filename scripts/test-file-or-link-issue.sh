#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-file-or-link-issue.sh — the ONE write-capable issue path is idempotent
# ACROSS THE SEARCH INDEX'S LAG, and still discriminates (issue #339).
#
# WHAT THE DEFECT WAS. `file-or-link-issue.sh` is this repo's only issue-creation
# path, and CLAUDE.md names marker-keyed idempotency as the reason it exists.
# That idempotency was a read-after-write against GitHub's issue search index,
# which is ASYNCHRONOUS. Measured 2026-09-04 against this repo: #337 filed at
# 21:05:37Z carrying marker `stale-issues-title-only-shipped-detector`; the SAME
# marker re-run at 21:05:44Z searched, got `[]`, and filed the duplicate #338.
# Seven seconds. The identical search four minutes later returned both. The
# marker footer was in #337's body the whole time and the query was correct —
# only the freshness assumption was wrong, and the script reported
# `{"action":"filed"}` both times, which every caller reads as success.
#
# AND NOTHING COVERED THIS SCRIPT AT ALL. `grep -l file-or-link-issue
# scripts/test-*.sh` returned nothing before this file: the property CLAUDE.md
# calls the script's defining one was enforced by prose alone, in a tree whose
# own convention is that a rule with no gate rots silently.
#
# WHY THE FIX IS TWO STAGES AND NOT ONE. `gh issue list` WITHOUT `--search` is a
# direct object read rather than a query against the index, so it returns an
# issue the instant it exists — but it is bounded to the newest N issues. The
# search is the mirror image: unbounded in age, not fresh. Neither alone is
# sufficient, which is why sections 4 and 5 exist as a pair with section 2:
# deleting the scan re-opens #339 (M1, M2), and deleting the search loses every
# marker older than the window (M6). This gate refuses to let a later
# "one lookup is enough, simplify" sweep drop either half.
#
# THE PREMISE IS ASSERTED, NEVER ASSUMED (section 1). #339's own point is that
# an unverified freshness assumption is the bug; replacing it with a second one
# would be the same bug wearing the fix's clothes. So before any verdict is
# trusted, the fixture proves ITSELF: the mock's `--search` path must NOT return
# a just-created issue (the lag, modelled directly, as an index-visibility set
# an issue joins only when the fixture says so) and the mock's DIRECT listing
# MUST return that same issue. Without both, every green below could come from a
# mock that simply answers "already-linked" to everything.
#
# EVERY BEHAVIOURAL VERDICT IS MEASURED AS A WRITE, not as a literal an
# assertion greps for: the harm is a duplicate ISSUE, so what gets counted is
# `gh issue create` calls in the mock's write log. That is also what keeps the
# mutation battery honest — no mutant here can be caught by a string that only
# happens to be present.
#
# THE DISCRIMINATION HALF IS LOAD-BEARING (section 3). A dedupe that answers
# `already-linked` to everything satisfies the reproduction and is useless, so a
# genuinely new marker must still file. Its sharp case is the PREFIX COLLISION:
# stage 2 matches the script-owned DELIMITED footer `<!-- <marker> -->` and not
# the bare marker, because `contains()` is a plain substring test and a bare
# match reports `epic-split: #207/alpha` as already-linked against an existing
# `epic-split: #207/alpha-two` — a real marker shape `groom-backlog` emits.
# M3 is that mutation, and it is the reason the two stages ask deliberately
# DIFFERENT questions; do not "align" the scan back onto the bare marker.
#
# UNKNOWN IS NOT VERIFIED (section 6). A scan that could not be PERFORMED is not
# a scan that found nothing, so the script exits 2 rather than filing blind —
# the same shape `align-labels.sh`'s delete gate takes, applied to the write
# that #339 is about. The tolerant `|| echo "[]"` form is what M4 restores, and
# it files a duplicate on exactly the input the guard exists for. Note the
# asymmetry, which is deliberate and not an oversight: stage 1 KEEPS its
# `|| echo "[]"` degradation, because stage 2 below it is the authority; the
# refusal belongs to the stage that is load-bearing for freshness.
#
# NOT COVERED, and deliberately so. A marker whose issue is BOTH older than the
# `--recent-scan` window AND not yet indexed is invisible to both stages —
# section 5 asserts that limitation rather than hiding it, and pairs it with the
# same input at a raised window, which is what proves the miss is the BOUND
# rather than a broken scan. Reaching it needs a repo to file more than N issues
# inside the index window, which the skill's burst rail already refuses. Also
# uncovered: GitHub's real index TTL, which is GitHub's and not worth pinning —
# the fixture models lag as visibility, not as time.
#
# NO REAL ISSUE IS EVER FILED. The reproduction in #339 was obtained against the
# live repo and cost a real duplicate; repeating it as a test would be the same
# mistake with a scripted trigger. Everything here runs against a PATH-shimmed
# mock `gh` under one `mktemp -d`: no repo, no network, no live issue read or
# written. Section 1 asserts the shim actually shadows the real `gh`, because a
# mock that failed to take effect is how a test suite reaches the network
# without saying so.
#
# Mutants are applied by EXACT WHOLE-LINE match through awk, which exits
# non-zero unless the target matched exactly ONCE — a mutation that drifted onto
# no line, or onto two, reports as stale rather than passing against a file that
# was never run. The inventory is the MUTANTS array; the run asserts every
# member ran, so no count here can go stale (#276).
#
# The cells reach awk through $ENVIRON rather than `-v`, and the transport is
# ROUND-TRIPPED and asserted before the battery runs. `-v` performs escape
# processing, three targets here end in a shell line-continuation backslash, and
# with `-v` this file passed on macOS's BWK awk and failed on CI's gawk claiming
# three stale mutations — a diagnostic that sends the reader to edit target lines
# that were correct. See apply_mutation.

#

# only when a fixture says so, so "filed but not yet searchable" is a state the
# fixture can express rather than a timing window a test would have to race.
#
# The `--json` field list is HONOURED rather than ignored: a script that stopped
# asking for `body` would get nulls and match nothing, so the mock cannot paper
# over that. MOCK_FAIL_LIST is scoped to the DIRECT listing alone — if it failed
# the search too, stage 1's `|| echo "[]"` would absorb it and section 6 would be

# backslash while one also carries `\"`. Measured 2026-09-04: with `-v`, all six

# environment byte-for-byte, so it is the transport with no escape layer at all.

# contains a backslash; do not read that as licence to switch back here.

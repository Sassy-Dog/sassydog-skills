# test-security-listing.sh — pins the rule that a security-labelled issue is
# never collapsed into a bare count (issue #219).
#
# Why a source-level guard. whats-on-fire's ranking is prose an agent follows,
# so the artifact under test is the instruction — the same shape as
# test-sentry-counts.sh, test-sentry-verification.sh and
# test-visibility-preconditions.sh.
#
# The bug it guards. The label map reached security ONLY through
# (`bug` AND `security`|`area:security`), so a security issue's visibility
# depended on whether it happened to be phrased as a defect. Most real security
# work is not: hardening, a missing control, an unmodelled sanitizer, a policy
# decision. Measured on velovate, two security issues filed the same day at the
# same severity: #2181 (`bug`, `security`, `sev:medium`) normalized to P1 and was
# listed; #2186 (`security`, `observability`, `sev:medium`) normalized to P2 and
# was absorbed into a bare integer. #2186 covers 72 open CodeQL alerts including
# 10 sites logging raw rider coordinates on a product live with real users'
# location history, and it was invisible in every daily-fire-watch post since it
# was filed.
#
# Four decisions are pinned, and 2 is the fragile one:
#
#   1. The `bug` conjunction is GONE from the P1 row. `bug` is a type, not a
#      severity multiplier.
#   2. The fix is a LISTING rule, not a promotion. #219 itself proposed
#      promoting `security` to P1 unconditionally, so a future reader arrives
#      pre-loaded with the rejected option — and promotion re-derives a priority
#      the maintainer already assigned, which this same file forbids two
#      paragraphs earlier. The gate asserts the tier is explicitly untouched.
#   3. `unranked` is covered, not just P2. An unlabelled security issue is the
#      most likely to be new and the least likely to have been triaged.
#   4. The "never re-derive a priority" principle SURVIVES. A listing rule that
#      quietly deleted the principle it was designed to respect would look like
#      a fix and be a regression.
#
# Must-not-exist assertions run against a WHITESPACE-FLATTENED copy, because
# this repo hard-wraps prose and a line-scoped grep turns a wrap into a false
# PASS. Must-exist checks may stay line-scoped: a wrap there fails loudly.
#
# No gh, no network: two tracked files.
#
# Wired into scripts/preflight.sh; run directly:
#   bash scripts/test-security-listing.sh

#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-template-actionlint.sh — lint setup-deps' WORKFLOW TEMPLATES by rendering
# them first (issue #245).
#
# Why this exists: `actionlint` is the gate this repo relies on for workflow
# correctness, and bare `actionlint` lints `.github/workflows/*` — which here is
# exactly one file, ci.yml. The three workflow templates setup-deps renders into
# every consumer repo were therefore linted by nothing, while being the
# highest-consequence YAML in the tree: `pull_request_target`, a minted
# PLATFORM_WRITER_APP_* token, and a push to a PR head ref. A defect there does
# not redden this repo's CI; it ships to consumers, where Dependabot answers a
# broken workflow by silently doing nothing.
#
# THE COMPLICATION, and why this is a render gate rather than a lint path:
# the templates are not directly lintable. They carry render-time placeholders
# (`# {{IF:FLAG}}` blocks and `{{TOKEN}}` substitutions), so pointing actionlint
# at the raw files produces parse errors that are not real defects. What has to
# be linted is a RENDER. #232's agent did exactly that by hand — rendering both
# lockfile templates four ways into a scratch repo and linting the results —
# and that manual step is what this automates.
#
# The render rules implemented below are the ones the template headers document,
# and nothing else:
#
#   1. drop the template's own header (everything before the `---` line)
#   2. `# {{IF:FLAG}} … # {{ENDIF}}` (at any indent) keeps its body and loses
#      its two marker lines when the flag is ON, and is deleted wholesale when
#      it is OFF
#   3. `{{TOKEN}}` is substituted with the variant's fact; a directory fact of
#      `.` collapses the `{{DIR}}/` PREFIX to nothing instead (a `./` prefix
#      breaks the on.paths filter — see the lockfile template headers)
#
# A bare `{{DIR}}` with no trailing slash is deliberately NOT substituted on a
# root render: at the root the only correct renders of those are inside an
# IF-block that is deleted, so a surviving token means a render rule the recipe
# cannot express — the leftover-token assertion below fails loudly rather than
# emitting `'./ios'`.
#
# Four vacuous-green guards, because every way this gate could cover nothing
# looks identical to a pass:
#
#   - every tracked *.template.yml is covered by the matrix, and every matrix
#     entry names a tracked template (a NEW template is unlinted otherwise)
#   - every `{{IF:FLAG}}` appearing in a template is ON in some variant (a new
#     arm is otherwise rendered away in all six variants and never linted)
#   - a render carrying a leftover `{{TOKEN}}` or marker fails
#   - missing actionlint SKIPS only the lint calls locally (the coverage and
#     render assertions still run) and is a hard FAILURE under CI=true
#
# Mutation-proof (a gate that cannot fail is decorative), three ways: an
# expression defect must be caught, an unsubstituted token must be caught, and
# an unknown runner label that is NOT `sassy-dog` must still fail — the custom
# self-hosted label is declared to actionlint via a config file, so the
# tolerance is scoped to that one label rather than muting the rule.
#
# Wired into scripts/preflight.sh (which skips it under CI=true — ci.yml runs it
# as its own step, after the pinned actionlint install). Run directly:
#   bash scripts/test-template-actionlint.sh

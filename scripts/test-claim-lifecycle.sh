# test-claim-lifecycle.sh — a claim is WRITTEN as two things and CLEARED as one,
# and `promote` may only clear the half that is residue (issue #281); and the
# `not found` tolerance may only swallow a failure that IS a removal (#288).
#
# What the defect is. `issue-claim.sh claim` writes `--add-assignee @me` AND
# `--add-label in-progress` in ONE `gh issue edit`; `release` writes
# `--remove-label in-progress` and nothing else. Nothing in the tree clears the
# assignee, and on a CLOSED issue nothing should — that assignee records who
# shipped it. The residue is only reachable on REOPEN, where dispatch-ready's §4
# Claimed filter skips on "assignee set OR label state" (a disjunction) while
# its §3 defines in-flight as assignee AND label (a conjunction). So a reopened,
# re-promoted issue arrives in ready[] still assigned and is skipped as "another
# session got it" — false, silent, and it never dispatches.
#
# THE SECOND DEFECT THIS FILE PINS (issue #288, section 7b). The `not found`
# tolerance exists for gh's one non-idempotent edge — `--remove-label` of a
# label the REPO does not carry errors instead of no-opping — and it matched
# gh's bare error string. #281 scoped it to the subcommands that carry a
# removal, which fixed `promote` and left the other half standing: gh's error
# names one label and says nothing about which FLAG it came from, so `claim` and
# `block`, which carry an `--add-label` too, went on swallowing a WHOLLY-failed
# edit whose failing operation was the ADD. `ensure_label` runs `|| true`, so on
# a repo where label creation fails the whole edit fails — nothing assigned, no
# `in-progress`, `ready` never stripped — and the run reported `ok`, which is
# all a coordinator ever sees: dispatch-ready re-dispatches the same issue on
# its next tick, two cold agents, two PRs, one issue. The tolerance is now keyed
# on each subcommand's OWN removal tokens, and BOTH halves are pinned, because
# either alone is wrong — the strict cases are satisfied by deleting the
# tolerance outright, and the tolerated-edge cases by never scoping it. `block`
# appears TWICE in that table because it is the only subcommand with two
# removals, and a list that dropped its second token would still pass a
# single-token case.
#
# MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED (gh 2.98.0, 2026-08-28, probed with two labels that
# exist in no repo, which gh refuses before it mutates anything): the message is
# `failed to update <issue-url>: '<label>' not found`, identical for an add and
# for a removal. WHICH token it names when BOTH are unresolvable is a
# goroutine-scheduling race rather than a rule — gh runs the add and the remove
# as separate `errgroup` closures and returns whichever failed first
# (`pkg/cmd/pr/shared/editable_http.go`, `UpdateIssue`) — and nothing here
# relies on it; both orderings reach `failed`. The MOCK names the argv-first
# missing token, which is a fixture convention, not a claim about gh. The mock
# reproduces that message WHOLE, and errors only for a label the invocation
# actually names — both halves are load-bearing here. The URL is why $MOCK_REPO
# is owned by `already`: the shipped tolerance matches the QUOTED token, and
# without a URL in the fixture a bare-substring match would pass every case.
# Scanning the argv is why a tolerated-edge row cannot certify its own premise:
# the removal list has two homes, and a knob that errored unconditionally
# reported `ok` about a removal the subcommand had stopped performing.
#
# THAT RESIDUE IS NOW CLOSED (issue #323), and the premise it rested on was
# wrong. It read: "an edit that failed on the removal token wrote nothing
# either, so `claim`/`block` still report `ok`". #288 measured that with two
# labels that exist in no repo — where gh refuses before mutating and names the
# REMOVAL, which is still true and still scopes the token match. It does not
# generalise to ONE bad token: measured on gh 2.100.0, 2026-09-04 against a live
# repo, adds and removes are INDEPENDENT, so a `block` naming an absent
# `in-progress` ADDED `blocked`, KEPT `ready`, and reported `ok`. The shipped
# script now re-issues the edit without the named removal, so every surviving
# removal and every add gets its second chance. Section 7b tests that repair:
# each tolerated-edge row names what the re-issue must still carry, and for
# `block` that is the OTHER removal — #323 itself.
#
# Why the two obvious fixes are NOT what is tested here. Both were considered
# and rejected on #281, and both are the shape a later "make this symmetric"
# sweep reaches for, so each is pinned as a NEGATIVE:
#   - making `release` symmetric destroys the who-shipped-it record on every
#     closed issue, so section 5 asserts `release` still clears no assignee;
#   - aligning §4's disjunction to §3's conjunction throws away the guard for a
#     human who self-assigned without setting in-progress, so this gate never
#     reads dispatch-ready/SKILL.md at all and nothing here licenses that edit.
#
# THE PREMISE IS ASSERTED, NOT ASSUMED (section 2). The discriminator is only
# sound because `claim` always writes both halves together. If `claim` ever
# splits that into two edits or drops the label, it silently stops
# discriminating and this gate's whole argument collapses — with every case in
# section 3 still green, because they exercise `promote`. So the pairing is
# pinned behaviourally on its own.
#
# THE PROBE'S TRANSPORT IS ITS OWN FAILURE MODE (section 4). The gate reads
# assignees and labels in one call, and the assignee field is EMPTY on the
# ordinary promotion. `@tsv` through `read` cannot carry that: TAB is IFS
# *whitespace*, so a leading empty field collapses and an unassigned issue reads
# its own LABELS as its assignees — measured, `IFS=$'\t' read -r a l` on
# $'\tready,bug' yields a=ready,bug. The shipped probe emits one value per line
# and reads with `IFS=`. That bug is invisible to an unassigned fixture carrying
# NO labels, which is the one unassigned shape the broken idiom reads correctly,
# so section 4 fixes both the fixture and, following #263 and gate 11, proves
# the fixture adequate by running the pre-fix idiom against it.
#
# EVERY ASSERTION ABOUT THE GUARD'S BEHAVIOUR IS BEHAVIOURAL, against a mock
# `gh` that records writes. That is deliberate: a source-level grep for the
# guard's wording is satisfied by a guard that no longer runs, and the failure
# this gate exists to catch is an assignee stripped from a human's issue —
# which is a WRITE, so a write is what gets measured. It also means no mutation
# here can be the tautological kind `scripts/test-sentry-verification.sh`'s
# header warns about: each is caught by the edit it causes, never by a literal
# an assertion greps for.
# Section 10 is the ONE source-level check, and it reads `SKILL.md` rather than
# the guard — it exists so the shipped documentation cannot drift away from a
# subcommand that now performs an assignee write (the #220 class).
#
# The mutants are applied by EXACT WHOLE-LINE match through awk rather than by
# sed regex, and awk exits non-zero unless the target matched exactly ONCE — the
# #262 lesson, one door further along. `cmp -s` alone is not enough (it exits 2
# on a missing file, which an `if` reads as "differs", so a sed that matched
# nothing reports "mutation applied" and every negative assertion after it
# passes against a file that was never run); "matched exactly once" also refuses
# a mutation that silently rewrote two sites or drifted onto none. The mutant
# inventory is the MUTANTS array below — the run prints its length and asserts
# every member actually ran, so no count here or elsewhere can go stale (#276).
#
# No taxonomy value is transcribed here. The mock's label store is seeded from
# `issue-claim.sh taxonomy`, because a colour pasted into this file would be the
# third-copy defect gate 8 exists to catch (issue #167) and this file is not on
# its allowlist.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT, not covered and deliberately so: `@me` is the OPERATOR's login,
# so the loop's residue and the operator's own self-assignment are
# indistinguishable here. Narrowing that needs positive evidence of a completed
# claim cycle, a fourth conjunct #281 does not sanction; it is filed as #287.

# in exactly one ok/bad, and each mutant contributes exactly one whether it is
# applied, run, or refused), so the total is deterministic. A floor is what this
# was, and it was measured useless — at `${#MUTANTS[@]} + 2` the whole of
# sections 3 through 9 could be deleted and the run still passed. An equality
# cannot rot silently in either direction: deleting a case fails it, and adding
# one forces a deliberate bump here rather than a quiet drift.

# adding one case while removing another nets zero and passes silently either

# test-detect-hook-stack.sh — proves setup-hooks' tracked-file probe still
# answers correctly when the match list is LARGE (issue #172).
#
# Why this exists: the bug it guards inverts a boolean and reports nothing.
# `has_tracked` used to be `git ls-files "<glob>" | head -1 | grep -q .`, and
# under the script's `set -o pipefail` that returns 141 whenever the match list
# outruns the ~64KB pipe buffer — `head`/`grep -q` exit on the first line, the
# writer takes SIGPIPE, pipefail promotes the writer's status. A MATCH reads as
# a MISS, so the rendered hook silently drops that tool's route. It is
# size-dependent: every small repo, and every small fixture, passes either way.
# That is the whole reason the fixture here is 20k paths and not 20 — a small
# fixture would prove nothing, which is why property 1 below fails loudly if the
# fixture ever stops being big enough to trip the old shape.
#
# Five properties are asserted:
#
#   1. The big fixture IS big enough: the PRE-FIX shape, transcribed here,
#      returns non-zero on it despite thousands of matches. If that shape ever
#      starts succeeding, this test is no longer testing anything and says so.
#   2. The SHIPPED has_tracked — extracted from detect-hook-stack.sh, not
#      transcribed — returns 0 on that same corpus, for every extension the
#      five affected detections probe.
#   3. End to end, the shipped detector run inside the big fixture reports
#      markdownlint / shellcheck / dotnet_format as DETECTED. Before the fix all
#      three came back false on this exact fixture.
#   4. No behaviour change in the common case: on a small fixture, where the old
#      shape was never wrong, the shipped detector's verdicts are unchanged.
#   5. Source-level shape guard: the shipped has_tracked contains no `head` and
#      no pipeline. Property 1 depends on a measured buffer size; this one holds
#      even if a future platform's pipe never blocks.
#
# Fixtures are built in a temp dir from a git index only (no working-tree
# files), which is why 20k paths costs ~100ms. Nothing here touches a real repo,
# the network, or the checkout it runs from.
#
# Wired into scripts/preflight.sh; run directly:
#   bash scripts/test-detect-hook-stack.sh

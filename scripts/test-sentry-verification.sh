# test-sentry-verification.sh — pins setup-config's Sentry project VERIFICATION
# decision and the `sentry: none` contract exception (issue #213).
#
# Why a source-level guard and not a render test. Nothing here is executed by a
# script: `setup-config` is a generator whose Sentry rule is prose an agent
# follows, so the artifact under test is the instruction itself — the same shape
# as test-visibility-preconditions.sh (setup-deps' two preconditions) and
# test-label-migrate.sh (align-labels.sh's single-call-site invariant).
#
# The bug it guards. A Sentry project slug and a GitHub repo can share a name and
# belong to DIFFERENT codebases — a marketing-site repo `<product>-web` beside a
# Sentry project `<product>-web` fed by a member-app frontend living elsewhere.
# The old rule ("list projects for the org to propose {{SENTRY_PROJECTS}}") made
# name similarity the only evidence, which is also the evidence an agent reaches
# for first. Every consequence is invisible after the fact: the wrong repo claims
# another codebase's P0s, two repos double-report the same issues, `take-it` is
# dispatched at a repo holding no such route — and BOTH plates still render
# complete, so nothing signals the error.
#
# Four decisions are pinned, and the last three are the fragile ones:
#
#   A. Verification is by CULPRIT, not by name, and a failed verification writes
#      `sentry: none` rather than a guessed block.
#   B. `sentry: none` is the config contract's FIRST documented exception to
#      "presence is the toggle". That exception is exactly the kind of prose a
#      later "align with the governing principle" sweep deletes as an
#      inconsistency — it reads like drift and is in fact the decision.
#   C. The `none` form now spans FOUR keys and is deliberately ASYMMETRIC across
#      them (issue #261): `sentry: none` keeps its blind-spot row, while
#      `testflight: none`, `posthog: none` and `mobile: none` render one `(n/a)`
#      token on the clean line and no row at all.
#   D. The CARRY-FORWARD carve-out covers those same three and NOT `sentry:`
#      (issue #268). `setup-config` writes `sentry: none` when the culprit check
#      merely COULD NOT RUN — no MCP server, no issues to sample — so freezing it
#      lets one unlucky session permanently retire the plate's highest-signal
#      surface, the only contradicting evidence being the check the carve-out
#      just skipped. The three/four split is asserted on all four sites that
#      state it: `SKILL.md`'s Guardrails list (which CLAUDE.md names as the copy
#      to trust), `SKILL.md` Phase 4, `config-contract.md`, and `update-mode.md`.
#      #267 added `sentry:` to the guardrail list while removing it from the
#      other two, so the same file contradicted itself forty lines apart and
#      nothing here noticed.
#
# Why C needs a gate rather than a paragraph. A four-key form where one key
# behaves differently reads as a plain inconsistency, so it is precisely what a
# tidying sweep "fixes" — in either direction, and both directions are silent.
# Collapsing `sentry: none` onto the clean line restores the gap #213 opened the
# form to close: a repo with no error monitoring stops being told so. Promoting
# the other three back into rows restores #261: an infra repo with no app carried
# three permanently unclearable rows on every plate, two of them in the loudest
# position the section has, which is how a reader learns to skim the heading that
# a genuinely dark Sentry lives under.
#
# The four-key table is checked by COUNTING its rows, not by looking up the four
# names — a lookup passes just as happily on a table that grew a fifth key or
# lost one, and "how many keys behave which way" is the whole decision.
#
# SIX ways this gate was MEASURED reporting a clean tree on a source stating the
# inverse. Every one is a scoping error, and every fix is the same shape:
#
#   * §6's Confirmed-N/A rule stated BOTH outcomes inside ONE window, so neither
#     was pinned (issue #268). Replacing "**`sentry: none` is the deliberate
#     exception and keeps its blind-spot row**" with "…is aligned with the other
#     three and takes the clean line too" left this gate GREEN — deleting
#     sentry's affirmation made the three-key row veto MORE likely to pass, not
#     less. #213's gap restored in the one section an agent follows when
#     rendering, and §3A was already carrying the identical lesson. The block is
#     now cut at the key literal, sentry's half carrying the INVERTED
#     expectations, and that half must never be folded back into the loop.
#   * The `### Blind spots` rules were checked by CO-OCCURRENCE — `sentry: none`
#     anywhere in the subsection AND `produces a row` anywhere in it — so
#     swapping which key gets the row satisfied both halves and stayed GREEN.
#     Split per key, same shape as §6.
#   * §3A's `sentry:` rule was covered by nothing, because the per-key loop runs
#     over the three clean-line keys only. Rewriting §3A to put `sentry: none` on
#     the clean line left this gate GREEN — the headline decision unpinned in the
#     one section the loop calls authoritative. It now has its own block with the
#     expectations INVERTED, and the loop must never be widened to swallow it.
#   * The per-key windows read the whole flattened file, so they landed on §6's
#     prose and a reverted §3 probe rule read as covered. Windows are scoped to
#     §3.
#   * `update-mode.md`'s rule was checked file-wide for 'stop and surface', which
#     step 1's unrelated rename-collision rule already satisfies. Inverting the
#     rule to "always silently rewrite a `none`" left it printing ok. Windowed.
#   * §2c's per-key check was a bare `grep -q "$key"`, which its own rationale
#     sentence satisfies ("an absent mobile app is a product fact"). It now
#     requires the literal `<key>: none` the question actually writes.
#
# HOW THIS GATE WAS MEASURED, and the methodology lesson, which is the part worth
# keeping. FOUR review rounds have each found assertions here passing on sources
# that state the inverse, and the reason the author's own mutation set kept
# reporting "all detected" is that every mutation was written by deleting the
# exact literal its assertion greps for. Such a set is tautologically caught: it
# proves `grep` works, not that the assertion pins a decision. A mutation must
# invert the MEANING and be worded the way a tidying editor would word it —
# different verb, different emphasis, different sentence shape.
#
# **NO INVENTORY NUMBER IS CARRIED HERE, DELIBERATELY.** This header used to
# claim a mutation count and an assertion count; both were wrong, and CLAUDE.md
# repeated one of them into the one place a future editor trusts instead of
# re-measuring (issue #268). A number nobody can re-derive from the tree is not
# worth carrying. The run prints its own assertion count, and the mutation
# batteries live in the PR that added them — re-measure rather than transcribe.
#
# The failure family is always the same:
#
#   * NEGATION-BLINDNESS, and the two failed attempts at fixing it. `grep -qi
#     'blind-spot row'` matches inside "**no** blind-spot row". Vetoing the word
#     `no` anywhere in the window was tried three times and defeated each time,
#     because it vetoed a negator that merely SHARED the window rather than one
#     GOVERNING the mention. The six-verb affirmative that replaced it enumerated
#     an OPEN class, so `plus a blind-spot row in §6` and `also produces` evaded
#     it while the correct rewords `keeps a blind-spot row` and `gets its own
#     blind-spot row` reddened the gate on prose that was RIGHT — measured, six
#     correct edits turned `main` red. Destinations are now matched
#     verb-independently and each mention is classified against its own bounded
#     left context, against a negator set whose CORE is a closed grammatical
#     class, resolved by polarity rather than by list length. See `dest_tally`.
#   * A MARKER IS NOT A DESTINATION. `\(n/a\)` sat inside the clean-line
#     vocabulary, so "they appear under Blind spots with an explicit `(n/a)`
#     marker" satisfied a clean-line assertion, and §3A's Sentry rule reddened
#     the moment it named the marker it must not use. Separate constants now.
#   * POLARITY, NOT A LONGER LIST. `is not exempt from a blind-spot row` AFFIRMS
#     the row, and `exempt`/`excluded`/`omitted` are words this file's own header
#     cites as natural here — so reading them as negations put the inverse of
#     #261 past both the `'0'` and the stricter `'-'` veto at every call site.
#     The fix is `cancelled()`: a second negator governing the first flips the
#     polarity back. Adding words to the negator list is the move that feels
#     like the fix and is not — that is what the six-verb `BLIND_AFFIRM` did.
#   * SILENCE IS NOT A NEGATION. `'0'` tested only "nothing affirmed", so a rule
#     whose negative clause drifted out of its window scored 0/0 and the veto
#     printed `ok` while measuring nothing. Rules that STATE a negative now use
#     `'-'`, which requires the negation to be present and measured.
#   * WINDOW SIZING, wrong in both directions: 460 bytes read half of a ~930-byte
#     rule and a must-not-exist slipped past; 400 bytes let one key's assertions
#     be satisfied by the next key's rule, ~158 bytes away. Hence `window_between`
#     and the structural `No key at all` bound. And a cap that binds BEFORE its
#     stop marker is the same defect wearing the other face — `carry_win`'s last
#     asserted phrase ended at byte 933 of a 937-byte window — so
#     `window_is_bounded` now asserts every such window ends where it says it
#     does.
#   * A WINDOW THAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE CHECK IS WRONG FOR ANOTHER. The `none`
#     clause is the right scope for "does it keep its row"; it is the wrong scope
#     for "does this rule ever mention the clean line", because a contradictory
#     clause appended to the rule's absent-key half lands outside it. Both scopes
#     are asserted.
#   * TALLYING IS NOT CLASSIFYING. Counting two patterns left a fifth key whose
#     behaviour column matched neither invisible — and the row filter keyed on a
#     backtick, so a row a human hand-adds without code formatting was invisible
#     too. Every row must be ACCOUNTED FOR.
#   * PREFIX ANCHORS. `grep -qi 'cannot re-derive is the'` is satisfied by
#     "…is the **surface**", the exact inversion of "…is the **confirmation**".
#   * A MENTION IS NOT A COMMITMENT. `grep -qi 'migrate mode'` was satisfied by a
#     sentence *demoting* migrate mode, so the check now requires the list entry.
#   * EMPHASIS. `The exception is scoped to **`sentry:`** alone.` slipped past a
#     check on the plain flatten, so must-not-exist checks also run against an
#     emphasis-stripped copy.
#
# Two more traps worth naming. The example-block must-not-exist check reads a
# FLATTENED copy: markdownlint's MD013 is off here, so a hard-wrapped row is
# invisible to a line-scoped grep — measured both ways. And a `\`` inside a
# double-quoted `ok`/`bad` message is COMMAND SUBSTITUTION, not a literal: three
# messages in this file ran `sentry: none` as a command before they were escaped.
#
# The prior-claim sibling scan is pinned as SECONDARY on purpose: promoting it to
# the guard would re-open the hole in every cloud session, which has no sibling
# checkouts on disk and so finds nothing while reporting nothing.
#
# Must-not-exist assertions run against a WHITESPACE-FLATTENED copy of the file.
# This repo hard-wraps prose, so forbidden wording routinely straddles two lines
# and a line-scoped grep reports a FALSE PASS. (Must-exist checks may stay
# line-scoped: a wrap there fails loudly, which is safe.)
#
# No `| grep -q` pipeline here takes a command as its writer: every one is fed by
# a single-argument `printf`, the shape scripts/test-pipefail-grep.sh permits.
# MEASURED, because an earlier version of this file asserted a size limit that
# does not exist: `printf '%s' "$one_unterminated_line" | grep -q` returns 0 at
# 64KB, 256KB, 1MB and 4MB on both bash 3.2.57 and 5.3.15, because `grep -q`
# cannot exit early on a line whose terminator it has not seen — and `tr '\n' ' '`
# makes every haystack here exactly one unterminated line. A COMMAND writer
# emitting many lines returns 141 at 64KB, which is the shape #256's syntactic
# rule targets and the reason that rule cannot be replaced by a size check.

# --- I. `none` is ASYMMETRIC across the four keys (issue #261) -----------------
#
# `sentry: none` keeps its blind-spot row; `testflight: none`, `posthog: none`
# and `mobile: none` render one `(n/a)` token on the clean line and no row. Both
# halves are load-bearing and a sweep can break either one silently, so both are
# asserted — never "the three behave alike" on its own, which a table that also
# moved `sentry` onto the clean line would satisfy.
#
# HOW THE ASYMMETRY IS TESTED (issue #268 rewrote this; read before changing it).
#
# A rule is classified by the DESTINATION it sends a key to — the blind-spot row
# or the clean line — and each destination is a noun phrase naming a place. Two
# earlier designs are recorded here because both are tempting and both failed.
#
#   1. "Assert the phrase, then veto the word `no`", tried three times, defeated
#      each time by a rewording: `**no** blind-spot row`, `never`, `does not`,
#      `no such`, `aligned with the other three`. It vetoed a negator ANYWHERE in
#      the window rather than one GOVERNING the mention, so it was wrong in both
#      directions at once.
#   2. The six-verb affirmative `(gets|keeps|renders|carries|receives|earns)…`
#      that replaced it. Verbs are an OPEN class, so `plus a blind-spot row in
#      §6`, `also produces a blind-spot row`, `they get a blind-spot row` and
#      `are given a blind-spot row` all evade it — every one of them correct
#      English — while the two natural rewords `keeps a blind-spot row` and
#      `gets its own blind-spot row` reddened the gate on prose that was RIGHT.
#      A gate that fails on a correct edit teaches the next author to loosen it.
#
# So: the destination is matched verb-independently, and each occurrence is then
# classified AFFIRMED or NEGATED against its own bounded left context. Requiring
# a negator to GOVERN the mention is what the three earlier attempts lacked.
#
# BE PRECISE ABOUT WHY THIS ENUMERATION IS ALLOWED WHEN THE VERB LIST WAS NOT,
# because "the list works after all" is the reading that walks straight back into
# `BLIND_AFFIRM`. The negator set has two parts. Its CORE — no / not / never /
# neither / nor / without / nothing — is a closed GRAMMATICAL class: English does
# not coin new ones, so enumerating it terminates. The rest — exempt / excluded /
# omitted / instead / rather — are lexical, chosen because this repo's prose
# actually uses them, and that half is NOT closed. It is kept short on purpose,
# every addition has to be justified by prose in the tree, and it is never the
# thing doing the work: POLARITY is, which is what resolves `not exempt` and what
# no list of any length can do. Growing the lexical half in place of fixing
# polarity is the failure mode to refuse.
#
# `none` is deliberately NOT a negator. The literal key value sits immediately
# before its own destination in the one rule this gate exists for (``sentry: none`
# … keeps its blind-spot row``), so reading it as a negation inverts that rule.
# Contractions are left out for the same reason: `n.t` also matches `net`, and
# "the net effect is a blind-spot row" would classify as negated. This repo's
# rules are written without contractions; `does not` is covered by `not`.
#
# The marker is NOT a destination. `\(n/a\)` used to sit inside the clean-line
# vocabulary, which let "they appear under Blind spots with an explicit `(n/a)`
# marker" satisfy a clean-line assertion, and made §3A's Sentry rule redden the
# moment it mentioned the marker it must NOT use. It is its own constant now.
ROW_DEST='blind[- ]spot row'
CLEAN_DEST='clean[- ]line|clean today'
NA_MARKER='(n/a)'

# Tally the destination mentions matching ERE $2 in text $1, split into AFFIRMED
# and NEGATED. Prints "<affirmed> <negated>". Emphasis and backticks are stripped
# so `**no**` reads as `no`, and the haystack is lower-cased because awk's ERE
# has no case-insensitive flag.
#
# A negator GOVERNS a mention when it stands in the SAME CLAUSE as it and is not
# itself the head of a prepositional phrase about some other noun. Every clause
# of that rule was forced by a measured counterexample, so none of it is
# decoration:
#
#   * THE BOUND IS THE CLAUSE, NEVER A COUNT (issue #271). All three scans once
#     stopped after four content words — four POSITIONS in `cancelled` — and the
#     unit was wrong in BOTH DIRECTIONS AT ONCE, which is why no value of it
#     works and why this was never a constant to nudge. TOO SHORT: `The three
#     keys do not, in current practice, ever actually produce a blind-spot row`
#     put `not` past the budget and returned 1/0, a QUIET miss on the `'+'`
#     direction that matters. TOO LONG: raising the bounds from four to six
#     reddened the pre-#271 gate, because a wider window starts reaching
#     negators that belong to OTHER clauses — which is why PR #272 recorded the
#     limit in the source instead of tuning it away.
#     NO COUNT OF REDDENED ASSERTIONS IS QUOTED HERE, and the draft that quoted
#     one is why the rule is stated. The number depends on WHICH bounds you
#     raise (the two content-word ones alone give a different answer from all
#     three), one of the assertions it counted is renamed by this very change,
#     and after merge there is no bound left to raise, so nobody can re-derive
#     any of it. What holds the decision up instead is live and one edit away:
#     restoring a count bound to ANY of the three scans reddens the case named
#     for that scan below. So each scan runs until `clause_break` fires or the
#     text runs out, and #270 is SUBSUMED rather than kept beside this: it added
#     a boundary CHECK inside a count, and that check is now the entire bound.
#   * The PREPOSITION test is what an unbounded in-clause scan costs, and it
#     carries more weight now than it did under a budget. `a repo with no Sentry
#     keeps a blind-spot row` is an affirmation — the negator negates `Sentry`,
#     not the row — and it sits in the SAME clause, so no bound of any kind
#     excludes it and only this test does. A negator headed by
#     `with`/`in`/`of`/`for`/… is skipped. It was comment-only until #271 widened
#     the scan past it; the case named for it below asserts it now.
#   * CLAUSE BOUNDARIES, but only strong ones. `render \`skipped — not
#     configured\` **and a blind-spot row in §6**` is the LIVE §3A absent-key
#     rule and is an affirmation; `and` ends the search so it reads that way.
#     `,` and `or` are deliberately NOT boundaries — `does not get, or need, a
#     blind-spot row` is one negation, and treating either as a boundary stops
#     the scan inside the clause it belongs to. ALL THREE scans stop at the same
#     boundary, through one shared `clause_break` (issue #270). Two of them did
#     and `cancelled` did not, which reads as deliberate to a later reader
#     and was not: `that is not so. sentry is exempt from a blind-spot row` let
#     the PREVIOUS clause's `not` cancel a real negation, so the sentence read
#     AFFIRMED and could satisfy the very `'+'` veto that exists to catch it.
#   * PARENTHETICAL INSERTIONS are skipped whole, reading right-to-left: the
#     token bearing the closing comma opens the skip and the token bearing the
#     opening comma closes it. Both look-around scans carry it — `governed`
#     always did, `cancelled` gained it in #271 — and it is tested BEFORE the
#     clause boundary on purpose, because a bracketed region suppresses
#     boundaries and negators alike; testing the boundary first is what put a
#     config-key literal (`sentry:`) back in the way and made the `:` arm cost
#     what #272 measured. `post_negated` has none and needs none: nothing
#     measured asks it to read past an aside.
#     BUT A SKIP NEVER OUTLIVES ITS SENTENCE, and that half is not optional.
#     A comma is not always paired, so an unpaired one opens a region that
#     suppresses everything to its left — including a full stop — and the scan
#     then runs into the PREVIOUS clause, which is #270 wearing the skip as a
#     disguise. It is not hypothetical and it bit in both scans: measured, `it
#     is not, as a rule. for these keys, sentry is exempt from a blind-spot row`
#     read 1/0 (a real negation cancelled by a previous sentence, the QUIET
#     direction) and `sentry is not, as a rule. for these keys, the blind-spot
#     row is kept` read 0/1 (a false negation, the LOUD one) — the second of
#     those on MAIN as well, a defect older than #271, since that scan has
#     always had the skip. So a skip region still honours `hard_break`, the
#     subset of the boundary set an aside cannot contain: a full stop and a
#     semicolon, but NOT the comma, dash, conjunction or config-key colon that
#     asides are made of. `clause_break` is defined in terms of `hard_break`
#     rather than beside it, so the subset cannot silently stop being one.
#     ITS COUNTEREXAMPLES MOVED WHEN THE COUNTS CAME OUT, which is worth knowing
#     before deciding this bullet is over-explained. Under a budget the skip was
#     what kept a negator IN it, so `is not, as of #261, given a blind-spot row`
#     and `never, in ordinary practice, renders a blind-spot row` were the
#     strings that broke without it. There is no budget now and both classify
#     correctly with the skip removed — measured, not assumed. What breaks
#     without it is a negator that genuinely belongs to the aside:
#     `sentry, which has no posthog target, keeps a blind-spot row` and
#     `testflight: none is not, like sentry: none, exempt from a blind-spot row`
#     each invert, one per scan, and each is asserted below.
#   * `instead`/`rather`/`excluded`/`omitted` count as negators, because
#     `instead of a blind-spot row` and `rather than a blind-spot row` are how
#     this repo actually writes the negative half, and reading them as
#     affirmations turned correct prose RED.
#
# BOTH tallies are printed, and every caller accounts for both, because a probe
# for one of them is the "tallying is not classifying" failure this file already
# learned once on the four-key table. This is not the place to grow a parser:
# the aim is that where the rule is wrong it is wrong in the LOUD direction, and
# `assert_dest`'s `'-'` want exists so a rule that states a negative must be
# measurably negated rather than merely silent. AN AIM IS NOT A GUARANTEE, and
# the block below exists because the previous wording read as one.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT: COMMA PARITY IS A GUESS, and where the guess is wrong a scan
# reaches into the neighbouring clause. This is ONE limit with two faces, both
# measured, and it is stated rather than fixed because no rule over commas
# resolves it -- a comma is sometimes an aside delimiter and sometimes a clause
# separator, and nothing local to the token distinguishes them. The file already
# says `,` is deliberately not a boundary; this is the cost of that, now visible
# because #271 removed the count that had been capping how far it could reach.
#
#   1. A COMMA-JOINED SUBORDINATE CLAUSE is not bounded. `when the key is not
#      derived, as of #261, sentry is exempt from a blind-spot row` returns 1/0
#      and is a negation; so does the `because` form. The cancellation scan
#      crosses the aside `, as of #261,` and finds the `not` belonging to the
#      SUBORDINATE clause. QUIET, on a `+` check. NOTE THE FIX THAT DOES NOT
#      WORK, since it is the first thing anyone will reach for and it was
#      measured: adding `if|when|because|while|although|unless|since|where` to
#      `clause_break` changes NEITHER string, because the subordinator sits to
#      the LEFT of the negator and a backward scan meets the negator first. The
#      boundary that would work is the comma CLOSING a clause-initial
#      subordinate clause, which a token-local predicate cannot see -- it needs
#      a forward segmentation pass over the token array, which is a different
#      change from this one.
#   2. THREE COMMAS INVERT THE PAIRING. Right-to-left parity binds the first
#      comma-bearing token it meets to the second, so with three asides the real
#      one is left exposed: `sentry, which has no posthog target, as of #261,
#      keeps a blind-spot row` returns 0/1 and is an affirmation, the `no`
#      belonging to the aside. The `closed` guard is what makes the two-comma
#      form right, and the same guard is what makes this one wrong -- a token
#      here must both CLOSE one aside and OPEN the next, which the guard exists
#      to forbid because forbidding it is what fixed the two-comma case.
#
# The MITIGATION, which is why this is a limit and not a hole: `hard_break`
# stops every one of these at a sentence, so a mis-reach is bounded by the
# nearest `.` or `;` rather than by the file. NEITHER FACE IS A REASON TO
# RESTORE THE COUNT: the count bounded the damage without bounding the scan
# correctly, which is what issue #271 exists to say.
#
# A THIRD SHAPE OF THE SAME FAMILY IS FIXED HERE, and is recorded because a
# reader meeting the two above will assume it is not: `even though its absence
# does render a blind-spot row, that key is excluded` returns 0/1 on main and
# 1/0 here, correctly. Nothing about commas fixed it -- the relativizer stop in
# `post_negated` did, `that` handing the predicate to `key`. Where a rule other
# than comma parity can see the clause boundary, the boundary gets seen.

        # the direction of issue #268, again. Measured on main: `that is not so.
        # sentry is exempt from a blind-spot row` returned 1/0.
        #
        # It takes BOTH the raw token and its bare form because `bare()` strips
        # the trailing terminator. That is what made the boundary invisible to
        # `cancelled` rather than merely unchecked: a scan holding only bare
        # words cannot see a boundary at all, so passing `b2` twice here would
        # reproduce the bug while looking like the fix.
        #
        # THE DASH ARMS ARE LIVE NOW, and #271 is what made them have to be.
        # Until here they were EQUALITY tests reached only AFTER each caller had
        # skipped any token baring to the empty string, so they were dead in
        # every form: an attached dash never satisfied one (`special-` is not
        # `-`) and a standalone dash was skipped before the call. PR #272
        # measured exactly that and left them, because reviving an arm moves a
        # COUNT-bounded scan stops. Under a CLAUSE bound the calculus inverts. An
        # em-dash is a clause separator this repo writes constantly, and a
        # boundary that fails to fire no longer costs a word or two of window —
        # it lets the scan run on into the previous clause, which is #270 again.
        # So the arms now match a TRAILING dash rather than a whole token, which
        # takes in the attached form, and every caller tests the boundary BEFORE
        # the empty-bare skip each caller USED to run first. (That skip is gone
        # now -- an empty bare matches no negator arm, so nothing needed it --
        # but the ORDER it forced is the whole reason the arms were dead, which
        # is why it is described here in the past tense rather than deleted.)
        # Counted across the eight files this gate reads,
        # the tokens ending in an ASCII dash are the bare bullet `-` (74), the
        # table rule `---` (51) and the comment opener `<!--` (7) — so the arm
        # that changed behaviour most is the LIST BULLET, from inert to clause
        # boundary. That is the direction wanted (a new bullet is a new clause)
        # and no prose token was caught by it, but it is the part a reader
        # picturing an em dash will not have pictured. Measured per arm, and the ASCII pair was wrong in
        # BOTH directions before: `nothing - sentry keeps a blind-spot row` goes
        # 0/1 to 1/0 and `the key is not special- mobile is exempt from a
        # blind-spot row` goes 1/0 to 0/1. The unicode pair is subtler and the
        # cases below say so — a STANDALONE em or en dash already read correctly
        # on main, by the accident of a POSITION budget the same change deletes,
        # so only the ATTACHED form shows the arm was dead. The em-dash arm now
        # reddens two live-text assertions as well as both of its own cases.
        #
        # THE `:` ARM COST DISSOLVED, which is the outcome #272 guessed a real
        # clause bound might reach. The cost was never the arm: it was that
        # `cancelled` had no parenthetical skip, so an aside carrying a config-key
        # literal ended the scan early. `cancelled` has the skip now, and
        # measured, `testflight: none is not, like sentry: none, exempt from a
        # blind-spot row` goes 0/1 back to 1/0 while its colon-free control stays
        # 1/0 — the two AGREE again, which is the whole of it. The arm itself
        # stays and is not decoration: neutering `:` alone reddens three
        # live-text assertions plus the case named for it below.
        #
        # ONE HELPER, ONE EDIT — and it is now the only BOUND as well as the only
        # BOUNDARY, so the shared-helper risk #270 introduced is strictly larger
        # here than it was there. Adding `,` to this set rewrites all three scans
        # at once, and measured before the comma pair below existed that left the

        # absent error monitoring…`, both reddening correct prose. Only
        # post-positional participles count, and the scan stops at the same
        # clause boundaries.
        # THE APPOSITIVE REGION, and the discipline INSIDE it. Opening on
        # position alone was not enough: the first version tested the participle
        # and returned unconditionally, so nothing inside the region consulted
        # the copula rule, the preposition rule or the relativizer stop -- and
        # `the blind-spot row, with the mobile lane skipped, is fine` read 0/1
        # against main 1/0. That is the SAME reduced relative the copula gate
        # exists to reject, admitted through a door that never asked.
        #
        # WHAT SEPARATES THEM IS A SUBJECT. A participial appositive has none of
        # its own -- it is the participle, optionally behind adverbs, predicated
        # on the noun it abuts. The moment a NEW SUBJECT appears inside the
        # region (a relativizer, a preposition heading a fresh noun phrase, or a
        # determiner opening one) it is a clause with its own subject, and the
        # whole region becomes an ASIDE to be skipped rather than an appositive
        # to be read. `appos == 2` is that degraded state; it runs to the
        # closing delimiter and resumes after it, which is why `— the mobile
        # lane was skipped — is fine` reaches `is fine` and finds nothing.
        #
        # Relativizers and prepositions are the sets this file already carries.
        # ADVERBS are deliberately not enumerated -- an open class -- which is
        # why the rule tests for what DISQUALIFIES an appositive rather than for
        # what an adverb is, and why `, deliberately dropped —` and `, never
        # dropped,` still read.
        #
        # A COORDINATED adverb pair does NOT read, and that is stated rather
        # than fixed: `, quietly and deliberately dropped,` returns 1/0,
        # because `and` is a clause boundary and terminates the scan before the
        # participle. It is the natural extension of the two adverb examples
        # just cited, so a reader will expect it to work. It is not a
        # regression -- main returns 1/0 too -- and the fix would be to teach
        # the scan that a conjunction inside a bracketed region is not a clause
        # boundary, which is a change to `clause_break` and not to this block.

        # closed noun list is also an open class in disguise". The claim is

                # THE CLASS SPLITS IN TWO, and the split is grammatical. A

                # (`when`) each name a new subject in their OWN right -- `whose
                # target`, `where the key`, `when the key` -- so they stop
                # unconditionally. The SUBJECT relatives carry the antecedent
                # forward instead, so when one heads the destination directly
                # its subject IS the destination and `the blind-spot row that is
                # dropped` is a real negation.
                #
                # THE SPLIT WAS WRONG TWICE BEFORE IT WAS RIGHT, which is the
                # reason to distrust a shorter version of it. It began as
                # `whose` alone, then as one whole-class first-word exemption --
                # each time the members that name their own subject were sorted
                # by how the rule READ rather than by what they DO. `when`
                # travelled with the subject relatives for exactly that reason
                # and was the last one out: measured, `a blind-spot row when the
                # key is dropped` read 0/1 against 1/0 on main.
                #
                # THE CLASS IS ENUMERATED WHOLE, INCLUDING MEMBERS THAT CANNOT
                # FIRE, and the reason is a defect this split already shipped:
                # `whereby` and `wherein` are `where` with a preposition baked
                # in, they introduce a new subject exactly as it does, and they
                # were simply MISSING -- measured, both read 0/1 against 1/0 on
                # main. Meanwhile `who|whom` were being kept for completeness
                # though neither can ever fire here, a blind-spot row not being
                # a person. Keeping the unfireable members while omitting two
                # that fire AND regress is the inconsistency to refuse: a class
                # is enumerated by what it IS, and then behaviour follows.
                # `who` stays in the exempt half as a subject relative and
                # nothing pins it; `whom` is an OBJECT relative, so the split
                # own principle puts it with the unconditional group even
                # though it cannot fire either. Do not read the unfireable
                # members as evidence the exemption generalises -- the five

                # the destination as antecedent, `why` requiring a reason head

# --- The classifier's own clause bound (issues #270, #271) --------------------
#
# Every veto below that reads a DESTINATION — `assert_dest`, the sentence scans,
# and the four-key row classification, though not the plain `grep` assertions
# beside them — is only as good as this classifier, and nothing in this file
# tested the classifier itself — its behaviour was measured out of band and
# written into a comment. A comment does not redden. So the boundary #270 closed
# is pinned here, in both directions, against fixed strings that owe nothing to
# what any tracked file happens to say today. #271 then made `clause_break` the
# ONLY bound as well as the only boundary, which is why every arm of it now
# carries a case rather than only the arms #270 happened to exercise.
#
# SCOPE, stated so this is not read as coverage of the whole classifier, and
# re-derived rather than carried: what is pinned is every arm of the boundary
# set, `hard_break` in both directions, each scan's bound and its boundary
# check, the parenthetical skip in each scan that has one — its existence, the
# `hard_break` it still honours, the testing of the token bearing the comma, and
# the `closed` guard — `post_negated`s two guards and the preposition stop it
# must NOT acquire, `governed`s preposition test, and the CORE-versus-full
# negator split at the two places it decides something. Issue #268 and PR #269
# settled what the scan LOOKS FOR and this battery is not about that; it is
# about what BOUNDS the scan, plus the guards the bound turned out to have been
# supplying by accident.
#
# TWO PROPERTIES ARE ASSERTED AT SOURCE LEVEL because nothing behavioural can
# see them: `clause_break` must be an EXPRESSION of `hard_break`, and `negator`
# of `core_negator`. A copy that transcribes the subset instead classifies every
# string here identically — today — and then the two drift.
#
# Each case asserts the WHOLE `<affirmed> <negated>` tally, never one half of it.
# Probing one number is the "tallying is not classifying" failure this file
# already learned on the four-key table, and here it is worse: a case that
# stopped classifying altogether returns `0 0`, which satisfies every
# "nothing affirmed" probe while measuring nothing.
#
# WHICH CASE MEASURES WHAT has to stay straight, and #271 moved several of them.
# Under the old count bound a case could pass on the BROKEN classifier for a
# reason that had nothing to do with the boundary — the four-position lookback
# in `cancelled` stopped the scan before the boundary was ever reached — so this
# paragraph used to spend itself scoping a quantifier around that. The count is
# gone, and with it the whole class of accidental passes: nothing here stops
# short of a clause any more, so every case below fails for the reason its own
# heading names. Two cases kept their verdict and changed their JOB — the
# standalone em and en dashes, which read `0 1` in both editions for opposite
# reasons — and the dash block below says so where they sit. The standalone
# ASCII dash is NOT one of them: it changed verdict, `0 1` to `1 0`.
#
# `... and sentry is exempt ...` was deliberately ABSENT for that same reason
# and stays absent: it pins nothing either edition does not already do.
#
# COVERAGE IS DERIVED BY MEASUREMENT, never asserted, and no tally of it is
# written down here — a number nobody can re-derive is what a future editor
# trusts instead of re-measuring, which is this file's own rule. Every case in
# this battery was proved load-bearing by at least one mutation of the
# classifier that it, and for most of them only it, reddens. Two blocks are
# there because a mutation found NOTHING: the comma pair, because adding `,` to
# `clause_break` once left the ENTIRE gate green, and the per-arm block, because
# after #271 dropped the counts, neutering the ASCII-dash, en-dash, `but`, `so`
# and `then` arms each did the same. One shared helper is exactly what makes
# every one of those a single edit.

# is what `tail()` is for and what an *equality* test cannot do: measured,
# rewriting `tail()` back to `t == suf` — the tidy a reader who has only seen
# the spaced form would make — leaves all three standalone cases green and
# reddens the em- and en-dash attached ones, and ONLY those. The ASCII attached
# case survives that mutation, because the ASCII arm is the `[;:.-]$` regex
# rather than a `tail()` call; it is pinned instead by dropping `-` from that
# class (`[:|-]$` today -- the `;` and `.` moved into `hard_break`). Two mechanisms, one behaviour, and a fixture set covering either one
# alone reads complete. FOUR of the six

# string used to sit up beside `Direction 1` under a heading about the LOOKBACK:

# four-position window while the dash itself was inert. Same verdict here, the
# opposite reason — the arm fires and the scan stops — which is why it is filed

# from a closed list -- `member|set|list|paradigm|arm|case|entr` -- and so it
# could only ever find counts of the SAFE shape, since the rule above defines
# the unsafe one as a count floating FREE of its noun. Measured against the two
# wordings it was written for, it found nothing on one and, on the other, only
# the safe `one member` earlier in the same sentence: a decoy that a reader
# obeying READ THEM would read, judge safe, and move past with `the ten` four
# words away. A closed noun list is also an open class in disguise -- `face`,
# `guard`, `verb`, `form`, `word`, `string`, `fixture`, `scan`, `rule` are all
# counted things this file writes today and none was in it. That is the
# six-verb `BLIND_AFFIRM` lesson, committed inside the probe enforcing the rule
# against it.
#
# THE PROBE THAT WORKS CARRIES NO NOUN LIST AND NO VERB LIST. It sweeps for the
# number used AS the noun -- a partitive, which is the surface form of a count
# floating free of its set:
#
#   grep -oniE "\\b(of|among|across) (the |these |those |them )?(one|two| \
#     three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten|eleven|twelve|thirteen| \
#     fourteen|fifteen|twenty)\\b" scripts/test-sentry-verification.sh \
#     scripts/preflight.sh CLAUDE.md
#
# It finds BOTH original wordings (`ANY of the ten`, `eight of the ten`) and
# returns a couple of dozen hits across the three files -- few enough to READ,
# which is the point and the instruction. Counting them, or grepping for the
# phrasing you think you used, is how this was missed twice.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated rather than fixed, because widening a probe until
# the next reader finds the next surface form is the loop that produced the two
# before it. Keying on the PARTITIVE narrows it to one surface form, and the
# two wordings it was validated against both happened to share that form --
# which is exactly how each earlier probe was built, and the reason to write
# the blind spot down instead of adding an alternation. It misses:
#
#   * NON-PARTITIVE free-floating counts -- the number sits beside a noun, so
#     it reads safe by shape while the SET it counts may be elsewhere entirely.
#     THE LIVE INSTANCE is in `scripts/preflight.sh`, gate 26s closing
#     summary: "the five decisions, six tracked files" -- two counts floating
#     free, re-derived by no gate, and invisible to this sweep. Cited by its
#     CONTENT rather than a line number, because the number moved by 368 lines
#     the moment this branch added a gate above it, which is the same rot one
#     level down. It is named because the illustrative
#     examples that used to stand here alone (`the eight files`, `the four
#     names`, `the six-verb affirmative`) are every one of them gate-pinned or
#     adjacent-enumerated TODAY, so a reader checking the blind spot against
#     the tree would find nothing wrong and conclude it was theoretical. It is
#     not. That file is OUT OF SCOPE for this changeset and is being filed
#     separately; do not fix it from here.
#   * DIGIT forms -- `all 12 are pinned`. The sweep is spelled-out words only.
#
# A probe with a stated blind spot is honest about what a clean run means. The
# instruction stands: READ the hits, and do not assume a clean sweep is a clean
# tree.
#
# TIER 1 IS COMPLETE PARADIGMS. `be` and the get-passive are closed, so
# enumerating them terminates -- but the licence only holds if each is WHOLE,
# and the first draft shipped `be` missing only `am` (named as a deliberate
# absence) beside a get-passive missing `getting` and `gotten` with nothing
# said. Those two cost quiet misses wherever they were the only auxiliary
# present. TIER 2 IS TREE-JUSTIFIED, so it is enumerated by what the prose
# writes and its residual gap is stated at the call site instead. The cases exist
# because the alternative reading of an enumerated set is that it was fitted,
# and because TRIMMING is the unsafe direction: measured one member at a time,
# removing ANY member flips its own ordinary sentence to AFFIRMED, quietly, on
# a rule that states a negative.

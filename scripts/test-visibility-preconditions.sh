# test-visibility-preconditions.sh — pins the repo-visibility precondition AND
# the credential naming on EVERY setup-deps template that mints a GitHub App
# token (issues #178, #186, #316).
#
# Renamed from test-auto-merge-visibility.sh in #186: the subject was never the
# auto-merge workflow, it was the credential. Three templates mint
# PLATFORM_WRITER_APP_* from the same two org secrets — dependabot-auto-merge,
# lockfile-sync-bun, lockfile-sync-pod — and #178 gave the precondition to only
# one of them, leaving the other two rendering into public repos through the
# door it left open.
#
# The pair is PLATFORM_WRITER_APP_CLIENT_ID + PLATFORM_WRITER_APP_PRIVATE_KEY
# since #316; before that it was PLATFORM_WRITER_APP_ID, whose input
# `create-github-app-token` deprecated in v3.2.0. Both names exist in both org
# stores and they are DIFFERENT values, so property 9 asserts the templates mint
# with `client-id:` and that no `app-id:` survives IN THE MINT STEP — scoped
# there rather than file-wide, since a file-wide absence check is failed by the
# prose that explains the rule. The tempting
# shortcut is to pass the numeric App ID through `client-id`, which GitHub's JWT
# `iss` claim accepts, and which would silence the deprecation with no new
# secret while leaving an App ID in an input named client-id in every consumer.
#
# Why this is a source-level guard and not a render test. The render decision is
# not made by a script — `render-dependabot.sh` renders `dependabot.yml` only.
# The decision lives in SKILL.md prose that an agent follows, so the artifact
# under test is the instruction itself, the same way test-label-migrate.sh pins
# align-labels.sh's single-call-site invariant and test-detect-hook-stack.sh
# pins "has_tracked carries no pipeline".
#
# The bug it guards is the expensive kind: invisible at render time, surfacing
# weeks later somewhere else. Org secrets at `private` visibility (= private +
# internal) exclude PUBLIC repos in BOTH the Actions and the Dependabot store.
# Rendered into a public repo, `secrets.*` resolves to the empty string and
# `create-github-app-token` fails on that repo's next Dependabot PR — as an auth
# error that looks unrelated to the generator run that caused it.
#
# The two lockfile templates are the WORSE case, which is why narrowing this
# file back to auto-merge would be a regression and not a simplification:
# dependabot-auto-merge deliberately never checks out, while both lockfile-sync
# templates `actions/checkout` the PR head ref with the minted token in scope.
#
# Properties asserted:
#
#   1. SKILL.md probes visibility (`gh repo view … --json visibility`).
#   2. SKILL.md states the public → do-not-render rule.
#   3. The veto names ALL THREE templates, not just auto-merge (#186).
#   4. The render table carries the precondition on all three rows (#186).
#   5. The Guardrails section carries it as a standing rule covering the
#      lockfile templates too — guardrails are what a hurried reader checks.
#   6. The no-gate arm does not instruct an unconditional lockfile-sync render.
#   7. The skip report names the CONSEQUENCE and a workaround, so a public repo
#      that needs lockfile sync is not left at a wall with no next step.
#   8. dependabot.yml.template does NOT assert unconditionally that
#      dependabot-auto-merge.yml holds semver-major, because in a public repo
#      that workflow is deliberately absent and the claim would be false.
#   9. All three token-minting templates pass `client-id:` naming
#      PLATFORM_WRITER_APP_CLIENT_ID, carry the matching presence gate, and
#      retain NO `app-id:` input or PLATFORM_WRITER_APP_ID reference (#316).
#      Per-template, because the deprecation warning fires once per template and
#      a single-template assertion is how #178 came to cover one of three.
#
# No gh, no network, no repo mutation — it reads two tracked files plus the
# three token-minting templates.

#
#    The presence gate is asserted MECHANICALLY, not by its message. Its six
#    places (env key, `[ -n ]` test, `missing=` string, per template) were all
#    renamed here, and a message-only check certifies none of them. Three
#    mutations were GREEN against the message-only form and are red now:
#      - `[ -n "$APP_CLIENT_ID" ]` -> `[ -n "$APP_KEY" ]`: an unprovisioned
#        client ID stops being caught and dies later inside the mint, as the
#        opaque auth error this step exists to replace.
#      - env key `APP_CLIENT_ID:` -> `APP_ID:`: the variable is unset, `missing`
#        is ALWAYS non-empty, and every consumer's Dependabot PR hard-fails with
#        a bogus "Missing Dependabot secret(s)" even when provisioning is right.
#      - `exit 1` -> `echo`: the gate degrades to a warning and stops gating.
#    The env key is CAPTURED and compared, never spelled twice, so renaming it
#    consistently stays legal and renaming it in one place does not.
#
#    The absence check matches `app[-_]id` case-insensitively with optional
#    quotes: `"app-id":` and `App-id:` are legal YAML, resolve to the same

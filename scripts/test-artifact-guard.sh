# test-artifact-guard.sh — pins the stray-artifact guard template's behaviour.
#
# Why this exists: this hook's failure mode is SILENCE. Every degraded input is
# deliberately fail-open (exit 0), which is correct — a guard that breaks a
# session is worse than a stray PNG — but it means a guard that has stopped
# working looks exactly like a guard with nothing to report. Nothing goes red,
# no output appears, and the artifacts quietly resume piling up in the repo
# root. So the loud cases are asserted as hard as the quiet ones.
#
# Seven properties:
#
#   1. PostToolUse fires on an artifact written directly to the repo root:
#      exit 2 (the harness feeds stderr back for immediate self-correction) and
#      the message names the file.
#   2. It stays silent for the cases that are NOT strays — a file already in
#      tmp/, a nested path, a non-artifact extension. A guard that nags about
#      legitimate writes gets ignored, which is the same as being absent.
#   3. It reads all three path parameter spellings. `file_path` is Write's;
#      `path` and `filename` are the browser-automation screenshot tools'. The
#      confirmed real-world cause of this whole feature was a screenshot tool,
#      so missing one spelling misses the case that matters.
#   4. `.svg` is excluded on purpose — legitimate committed source in several
#      repos, and a false positive there trains people to ignore the hook.
#   5. Stop emits `{"decision":"block"}` naming the strays, as valid JSON.
#   6. Stop honours `stop_hook_active`. This is the one that wedges a session
#      if it regresses: Claude Code sets the flag session-wide while a stop
#      continuation is in flight, so re-blocking loops forever.
#   7. Every degraded input fails OPEN at exit 0 — empty stdin, malformed JSON,
#      an unknown event, a missing cwd, and running outside a git repo.
#
# Network-free and binary-free: scratch git repos and empty files. The template
# is exercised directly, so this gate fails on the template rather than on some
# rendered copy that may not exist yet in any consumer repo.
